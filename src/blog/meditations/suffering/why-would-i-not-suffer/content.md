> Why would I not suffer?

I've been thinking about that from multiple angles. It's not that
I believe that, in some pessimistic, sadistic, or masochistic view
that suffering is __good__. Contrarily, I view suffering as the
__consequence__ of separation from God. It isn't even implicitly good.
When God created us, it wasn't even in His original design. God
didn't intend for us to suffer.

If suffering is __not__ good, then why must I suffer? There are
many who would say,

> It's not necessary that you suffer. 

> Suffering is a product of your worldview.

> Sin isn't real; it's an arbitrary assignment of evil based
on archaic precepts.

I imagine there are a handful or more of other reasons that we
could explain away the reality of suffering, whitewash it into
comfort zones of the mind, or even ignore it entirely.

Believe me, I've tried to ignore it. I've tried to pleasure it away.
I've tried insomnia, binge-eating, alcohol, hyper-caffeination to
then fix the insomnia, and finally the combination of all of the above.
I realize now why people must live those lifestyles on repeat. Here's a hint for you:

__THEY DON'T FIX ANYTHING!__

That's why people never escape the bar hopping, the drunkenness, the
substance abuse... addiction, buyer's remorse, self-loathing, lather,
rinse, repeat.

It's all just one giant cluster of perpetuating lies. It'd be one thing
if, in isolation, we did those things, and we concluded we were better
off that way. We don't because, let's face it, we're not. We bring
people along for validation.

> We're happy right, guys? We're having a great time, right?
>
> ... aren't we?

We look anxiously across the room for validation, and so is
everyone else that's there. Why do we have to keep trying
to recharge the batteries with the poisons we pick, but we don't
come out feeling recharged? 

It sucks admitting that a fulfilling life is built on top of discomfort.
It's so much more fun to focus on the easy things; defer the hard things
for later. Does that mean suffering is prioritizing the things that we
keep deferring?

I can't prescribe a singular definition to what suffering is. It would
be selfish of me to do so. Suffering for me looks like avoiding the things
that I know would be good for me:

* Exercise
* Healthy eating
* Waking up early
* Going to bed early
* Reading more books
* Learning something new
* Reading my Bible more

I'm being incredibly transparent with you. These are the things that
I __consistently__ find myself procrastinating on. Have you taken
stock lately of the things that you're deferring?

Conversely, here are the things that I'm excelling at prioritizing:

* Playing video games
* Doom scrolling on my phone
* Eating processed foods
* Not drinking enough water
* Being sedentary

Does my list look like yours?

What's interesting is that __every time__ I prioritize the
things in that _defer_ list, I always end up feeling accomplished,
feeling aligned with what God designed for my body, mind, and spirit,
and feeling recharged.

Suffering is a universal truth only validated by the extent
and lengths that people will go to invalidate, ignore, whitewash,
and defer it. The daily repetitions of things that __should__
fix the disease only add onto it.

I look to the example of Christ who suffered. He suffered in ways that
I simply cannot. Suffering as a Christian acknowledges the presence of
suffering, but does not view it as hopeless. Contrarily, suffering enlightens us
to the hope of the future. Suffering aligns us to the righteousness of Christ.
If Christ suffered, why wouldn't we? I frame it this way.

Christ-like suffering is acknowledging that the complex range of adversity in
life exists. It's choosing to align your mind, body, and spirit with the
choices that reflect the righteousness of Christ, not selling your soul
to alcohol, substance, food, addiction, sexual immorality, or any combination
thereof. 

The main thing that differentiates my response to suffering today in
comparison with that of the past is that I now embrace it. When I embrace
suffering as the necessary consequence of living in a broken world, I can
then look forward to a time when it will not be so. I can do that because
I trust God's promises.

> But rejoice insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.

[1 Peter 4:13](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/1PE.4.13)

Suffering is not something to be avoided. It unifies you with Christ.
It is only good inasmuch as it enlightens me to the promises of the
future so that I don't become addicted, beholden, and a slave to the
present, and so I don't make idols of the useless things in this world.

> But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.

[Philippians 3:7-11](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/PHP.3.7-11)

If He suffered, why would I not suffer?
