Suffering. It's a word that carries weight, isn't it? Not the kind we chase or celebrate, but the kind that finds us in the quiet moments, in the cracks of our carefully constructed lives. I've wrestled with it—tried to outrun it, numb it, explain it away. But suffering isn't optional in this broken world. It's the shadow cast by separation from God, a reminder that things aren't as they should be.

Yet, in the Christian walk, suffering takes on a different shape. It's not meaningless pain; it's the forge where character is shaped, where faith deepens, where we glimpse the hope of redemption. Here, in these meditations on suffering, we'll explore its many faces—from the betrayals that wound us to the disciplines we choose, from physical aches to spiritual droughts. We'll look to Christ's example, who suffered beyond measure, and ask: how does our suffering unite us with Him? How does it point us toward a future where sorrow is swallowed by glory?

These reflections aren't about glorifying pain, but about embracing it as part of the journey. Because if He suffered, why would we not?
