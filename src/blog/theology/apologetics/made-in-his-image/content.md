We have now examined the two modes of revelation documented in Scripture—sensory and spiritual. God has spoken audibly from the burning bush, the whirlwind, and the heavens. He has also spoken through dreams, visions, trances, and the still small voice. The Biblical record testifies that God communicates with humanity through both physical and spiritual means.

This raises an important question. Why can humans perceive God at all? If God is transcendent—existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe—why would beings confined to the material universe have any capacity to perceive him? The naturalist worldview offers no answer to this question. But the Bible does.

The Genesis account provides a unique explanation for human spiritual capacity. We are made in the image of God. This single declaration has profound implications for the framework of revelation and reorganization, and it explains why humans possess an awareness of the transcendent that cannot be attributed to our own reorganization.

## The Declaration of Genesis

The Genesis account of the Bible states that God created humans in a particular way that distinguishes us from the rest of creation.

_'Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.'_

_Genesis 1:26-27 ESV_

This passage is remarkable for several reasons. First, it establishes a unique relationship between God and humanity that does not exist with the rest of creation. The animals were not made in God's image. The plants were not made in God's likeness. Only humans bear this distinction.

Second, the passage connects our bearing God's image with our having <abbr title="Sovereignty or control">dominion</abbr> over creation. There is a relationship between being made in God's likeness and our capacity to exercise authority over the natural order. This connection will become important when we consider the Logos in a later post.

Third, the language of "image" and "likeness" requires careful examination. What does it mean to be made in the image of God?

## The Meaning of _Tselem_

To understand what it means to be made in God's image, we must examine the original Hebrew word. According to Strong's Concordance entry [H6754](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/6754.html):

**Strong's #6754:** _tselem_ (pronounced tseh'-lem)

_from an unused root meaning to shade; a phantom, i.e. (figuratively) illusion, resemblance; hence, a representative figure, especially an idol:--image, vain shew._

A thorough analysis of this word choice clearly shows that the writer is conveying that we do not physically resemble God, but that we spiritually resemble God. The root meaning "to shade" suggests something like a shadow—not the thing itself, but a representation of it. We are not God. We do not possess God's attributes in their fullness. But we bear a resemblance. We are, in some sense, a reflection or representative figure of our creator.

This attribute of being made in the image of God is unique to the Bible as a holy text. No other religious text makes this specific claim about the relationship between the divine and humanity. This is not a minor theological point. It has profound implications for understanding human nature, human capacity, and human purpose.

## Spiritual Resemblance, Not Physical

The use of _tselem_ makes clear that the image we bear is not physical. God is spirit. He does not have a body in the way humans do, though he can and does take physical form when he chooses to reveal himself—as we saw in the Garden when his footsteps were audible, and ultimately in the <abbr title="The embodiment of God in the human form of Jesus Christ; God taking on flesh">incarnation</abbr> of Christ.

When Genesis says we are made in God's image, it is speaking of a spiritual resemblance. We bear the likeness of our creator in a spiritual sense. This means we have capacities and characteristics that reflect God's own nature, even if in a limited and finite form.

What are these capacities? We have already explored some of them. We have the ability to perceive God—both through our physical senses when he chooses to reveal himself sensorially, and through our spirits when he chooses to reveal himself spiritually. We have the capacity for rational thought, for language, for creative reorganization of the natural order. We have moral awareness, relational capacity, and self-consciousness.

None of these capacities are <abbr title="Able to be explained or accounted for; capable of being made clear">explicable</abbr> through <abbr title="The philosophical belief that everything arises from natural properties and causes, and supernatural or spiritual explanations are excluded or discounted">naturalism</abbr> alone. The <abbr title="A person who advocates or practices naturalism">naturalist</abbr> must account for all of these phenomena through purely material causes. But being made in the image of God provides a coherent explanation for why humans possess these unique characteristics.

## The Capacity to Perceive the Transcendent

Being made in the image of God means that God created us with the means to be aware of his presence. This is a critical point for the framework of revelation and reorganization.

We established earlier that humans cannot create transcendent concepts through reorganization. We have no means to construct the idea of a transcendent God from the properties and behaviors of the natural universe, because all human reorganization is constrained by those very properties and behaviors. Yet we possess awareness of the transcendent. How?

The answer is that God designed us with this capacity. Being made in his image, we bear the ability to perceive him. This perception is not something we invented or constructed. It is something God built into us when he created us. Just as our eyes are designed to perceive light and our ears are designed to perceive sound, our spirits are designed to perceive God.

This explains why humans across every culture and every era have possessed awareness of the divine. It is not because each culture independently invented the concept of God through reorganization—we have demonstrated that such invention is impossible. It is because God made us with the inherent capacity to perceive him.

## Unique Among Creation

The Bible presents humanity as uniquely positioned in creation. We are not merely the most advanced animals. We are not simply the product of natural selection reaching a particular level of complexity. We are image-bearers of the living God.

This distinction matters immensely for understanding revelation. Animals perceive the natural world through their senses. They respond to stimuli. They exhibit behavior that we might call intelligent. But animals do not worship. Animals do not conceive of transcendent beings. Animals do not ask questions about the meaning of existence or the nature of the divine.

Why not? If awareness of God were simply an emergent property of sufficient neural complexity, we would expect to see at least some evidence of it in other highly intelligent species. But we do not. Only humans possess this capacity, and the Bible explains why: only humans are made in the image of God.

The naturalist might argue that religious awareness is simply a byproduct of other cognitive capacities—pattern recognition taken too far, or agency detection misfiring. But this explanation does not account for the specific content of religious awareness. Pattern recognition might produce superstition. Agency detection might produce <abbr title="The belief that objects, places, and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence; attributing souls to natural phenomena">animism</abbr>. But neither produces the concept of a transcendent God who exists apart from the material universe, who spoke creation into existence, who dwells with his people and reveals himself through physical and spiritual means.

That specific concept cannot be explained through naturalist mechanisms. It can only be explained through revelation received by creatures designed to perceive it.

## The Dualistic Nature of Humanity

Being made in the image of a transcendent God means we have a dual nature. We are physical beings, made from the dust of the ground. But we are also spiritual beings, bearing the image of our spiritual creator.

This <abbr title="The division of something into two distinct parts; in philosophy, the view that mind and body are separate entities">dualism</abbr> is evident in how God reveals himself to us. He speaks to our ears, and he speaks to our spirits. We can hear his audible voice, and we can perceive his still small voice. We exist in the material world, but we have access to something beyond it—not because we earned this access or created it, but because God designed us with this capacity.

This dualistic nature is itself a form of revelation. The fact that humans universally sense that we are more than our physical bodies—that there is something about us that transcends mere matter—is evidence of how God made us. We sense this because it is true. We are both material and spiritual, just as God's revelation to us comes in both material and spiritual forms.

## Made for Relationship

The declaration that we are made in God's image is not merely an <abbr title="Relating to the branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of being, existence, or reality">ontological</abbr> statement. It is a relational one. God did not make us in his image accidentally. He did it intentionally, with purpose.

_'And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.'_

_Genesis 2:8, 15 ESV_

God created a garden and placed man in it. God walked in the garden. His footsteps were audible. He spoke directly with Adam. This was not a distant, <abbr title="Relating to deism, the belief that God created the universe but does not intervene in it; a remote, impersonal view of God">deistic</abbr> relationship. This was intimate communion between creator and creature.

Being made in God's image means we were designed for this kind of relationship. We were not created merely to observe God from a distance or to worship an abstract concept. We were created to know God, to hear his voice, to walk with him. The capacity to perceive God that comes from bearing his image is not incidental—it is the foundation of the relationship God intended from the beginning.

## The Love of God

The very act of God revealing himself to us indicates to us the nature of God's character. A God that would reveal himself to his creation not once, but a multitude of times indicates intent. It is God's intent that humans should know him. It is God's intent that his word should be recorded through the gifts that God has given his creation. It is God's intent that humans should have a relationship with him.

We can know this intent because it is recorded in the snapshot of the Bible. We don't need to guess, <abbr title="To infer or estimate by extending known information">extrapolate</abbr>, <abbr title="To put something forward as a hypothesis; to suggest as a possible explanation">hypothesize</abbr>, or infer. The very nature of revelation dictates that the pre-existing God of the Bible came before his creation and made himself known to us.

The artifact of God's word and that he allowed us to record it for future generations is an act of <abbr title="The quality of being well meaning; kindness; an act of kindness">benevolence</abbr>. The Bible isn't human-generated content because reorganization proves that God cannot be invented. The Bible is God's revealed word through his interaction with his creation. The very essence of God distilling his wisdom for us in the form of the Bible is a form of compassion and love for a creation that has time and time again neglected our position in the creator-creation hierarchy. This is yet one of many of God's graces.

## Implications for the Framework

The doctrine that we are made in God's image has direct implications for the framework of revelation and reorganization.

First, it explains why we can receive revelation at all. We are designed for it. Our capacity to perceive God is not an accident or an anomaly. It is how God made us.

Second, it explains why we cannot create the concept of God through reorganization. Being made in God's image does not make us God. We remain finite, limited, constrained by the properties and behaviors of the natural order. We can perceive transcendence, but we cannot create it. We can receive revelation of the divine, but we cannot manufacture it.

Third, it explains the dual modes of revelation we have examined. Because we bear God's image spiritually, we can perceive his spiritual communication—dreams, visions, the still small voice. Because we exist in physical bodies, we can also perceive his physical communication—the audible voice, the visible fire, the footsteps in the Garden.

Fourth, it underscores the unique position of the Bible among religious texts. The Bible does not merely claim that God exists or that God has power. It claims that God created humans in his image, with the specific capacity to know him and relate to him. It claims that God has revealed himself to this image-bearing creation through both physical and spiritual means, across generations, culminating in the incarnation of Christ—God taking on human form to dwell with his creation in the most intimate way possible.

## A Distinct Characteristic of the Bible

This attribute of being made in the image of God is unique to the Bible. This is a claim worth examining carefully.

Other religious texts may speak of gods creating humans. Other texts may speak of humans having souls or spirits. But the specific claim that humans bear the image of the one transcendent God—that we spiritually resemble our creator in a way that gives us the capacity to perceive him and relate to him—this is a distinctive Biblical doctrine.

This matters because the framework of revelation and reorganization requires an explanation for human awareness of the transcendent. We have demonstrated that this awareness cannot come from reorganization. It must come from revelation. But revelation requires a receiver who can perceive what is being revealed.

The Biblical doctrine of the <abbr title="Latin phrase meaning 'image of God'; the theological concept that humans are created in God's likeness">_imago Dei_</abbr>—the image of God—provides exactly this explanation. We can perceive God because God made us to perceive him. We can receive his revelation because he designed us as receivers. We are not passive observers of a distant deity. We are image-bearers of a personal God who has made himself known.
