In the previous post, we tested the limits of human creativity across mathematics, music, and art. We observed that even the most abstract human creations are constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature. Mathematics relies on number systems derived from quantifying objects in the natural world. Music depends on the revealed behaviors of harmonics and <abbr title="A harsh, discordant mixture of sounds; lack of harmony between notes">dissonance</abbr>. Artistic <abbr title="A mythical creature composed of parts from different animals; any imaginary monster made up of incongruous parts">chimeras</abbr>—unicorns, griffins, sphinxes—are <abbr title="Combinations or mixtures of different elements; things composed of diverse parts">amalgamations</abbr> of existing natural entities, not novel creations from nothing.

We also extended an invitation to <abbr title="To prove (a statement or theory) to be false; to refute">falsify</abbr> these claims. If any human creation can be demonstrated to exceed the properties and behaviors of nature, then humans possess the capacity for transcendence. No such example has emerged.

This brings us to the central question of this series: Can humans invent God?

## God Must Be Transcendent or Not

It is necessary to assert that God is either <abbr title="Existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe; beyond ordinary experience">transcendent</abbr> or he is not. There is no middle ground.

If God is transcendent, then he exists outside of nature and is not governed by the laws of nature. He is not measurable by the systems we use to understand the natural world. He cannot be leveraged, manipulated, or reorganized by human minds.

If God is not transcendent, then he is governed by the laws of nature. He is measurable by <abbr title="Based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic; verifiable through experimentation">empirical</abbr> means. He is necessarily able to be leveraged and used by human minds, much in the same way water, electricity, wind, and other materials are.

But this presents a definitional problem. A god that can be measured, manipulated, and leveraged by humans is not God. Humans who manipulate that version of god have power and dominion over that force. By definition, that is not God.

## If God Is Not Transcendent, He Is Not God

Of course, we know with great certainty that God is not measurable, nor is he able to be leveraged and reorganized by human minds, because there is no empirical evidence to certify those claims. No human has ever demonstrated the ability to command or manipulate the God of the Bible through natural means.

In addition, if we acknowledge that God is not transcendent and that he is part of the natural order, then he is not God because he is constrained by the system that he allegedly created. A god constrained by his own creation is subordinate to that creation. That is not God.

If God is not real and he is immaterial, then we are back to the claim that God is not only not transcendent, but also that God does not exist.

In either case where God is not transcendent or God is not real, this necessarily begs an important question.

## How Did We Come to Know About a Transcendent God?

If God does not exist, or if God is not transcendent, then how did we come to know about a God that is transcendent?

This is not a <abbr title="Of little value or importance; insignificant">trivial</abbr> question. The concept of a transcendent God—a being that exists apart from and is not subject to the limitations of the material universe—is not a concept that emerges naturally from the observation of nature. Lightning does not suggest a creator of all matter. Thunder does not imply a being outside of space and time. The properties and behaviors of the natural world do not, by themselves, yield the concept of transcendence.

The claim that God is a social construct <abbr title="Assumes beforehand; takes for granted without proof">presupposes</abbr> that humans have the capacity to create transcendent concepts through reorganization. But as we have established in the previous posts, reorganization is absolutely constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature. We can amalgamate existing concepts, rearrange known properties, and create novel composite systems. But we cannot exceed the natural order.

There is no basis in reality, nor any empirical evidence, to demonstrate where humans have ever reorganized a series of revealed properties or behaviors of nature to create something of higher magnitude than nature itself.

## If Humans Created God, Humans Would Be Transcendent

For God to be God, he must be necessarily outside the laws of nature. If humans created God, then this means humans are transcendent because humans have created something outside of nature.

This is a remarkable claim, and it deserves scrutiny.

If humans possess the capacity to create transcendent concepts through thought alone, then humans have exceeded the constraints of nature. We would be creators in the <abbr title="Relating to the branch of philosophy dealing with the fundamental nature of reality and existence">metaphysical</abbr> sense. We would have demonstrated the ability to <abbr title="To create or establish something; to bring into being">instantiate</abbr> concepts that exist apart from and are not subject to the limitations of the material universe.

However, there is clearly no evidence that humans are transcendent. Humans have never created anything that exceeds the constraints of nature. Not a single human invention—concrete or abstract—has ever transcended the properties and behaviors of the natural order. Human inventions do not instantiate matter <abbr title="Latin phrase meaning 'out of nothing'; creation from nothing">ex nihilo</abbr>. They do not instantiate new universes, or subsequent transcendent creations from that matter.

If humans could create the concept of a transcendent God, then we should be able to do it again. And again. And again. We should be able to create other transcendent entities by other names for other transcendent purposes. We should be able to create matter and universes by mere thought.

But we cannot. The limitation of language to even conjure up a transcendent entity on the spot, or to create matter ex nihilo, demonstrates the weakness of reorganization as a means to abstract transcendent beings.

## The Only Remaining Option

We are left with a logical conclusion.

God cannot be a product of human reorganization because we can firmly state that there is no basis in reality, nor any empirical evidence to demonstrate where humans have ever reorganized a series of revealed properties or behaviors of nature to create something of higher magnitude than nature itself.

If humans cannot create transcendent concepts, and yet we possess awareness of a transcendent God, then our awareness of God can only be explained one way: God has revealed himself to us.

This is not an argument from ignorance. It is an argument from constraint. We have established empirically that human knowledge acquisition operates through two and only two <abbr title="Modes or methods of doing something; particular ways in which something exists or is experienced">modalities</abbr>: revelation and reorganization. We have established that reorganization is constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature. We have tested this constraint against mathematics, music, art, and human invention. No falsifying example has emerged.

Until evidence demonstrates that humans are capable of acquiring knowledge via other means, or constructing novel creations by another means, then the claim remains grounded in reality: God is not a reorganization. God can only be a revelation.

## The Implications

If God can only be a revelation, then the <abbr title="Persons who disparage or criticize someone or something; critics">detractors</abbr> of faith face a significant problem. The claim that God is a social construct is not merely unsubstantiated—it is contradicted by the constraints of human knowledge acquisition. Humans do not possess the <abbr title="Relating to epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge">epistemological</abbr> machinery to create transcendent concepts through thought alone.

This does not prove God's existence through empirical means. God, by definition, is not measurable through empirical instruments. But it does demonstrate that our awareness of God cannot be attributed to human invention. The concept of a transcendent God is not something we could have fabricated from the properties and behaviors of nature.

Our awareness of God must be attributed to something outside of human reorganization. And if it is outside of human reorganization, it can only be revelation.

The question that remains is this: If God has revealed himself to us, how has he done so? Has God revealed himself only spiritually, leaving us with an <abbr title="Intended for or understood by only a small group with specialized knowledge; mysterious or obscure">esoteric</abbr> God who does not interact with humans in perceivable ways? Or has God interacted with humans in ways we can perceive—through our senses, through direct communication, through dwelling with his creation?

The Biblical record provides a compelling answer to this question. That is where we will turn next.
