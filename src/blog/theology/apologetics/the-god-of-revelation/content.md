This series exists to make a case. Not a case built on emotional appeals or blind faith, but a case grounded in logic, reason, and empirical observation. The goal is to demonstrate that belief in the God of the Bible is not only rational but defensible through the same epistemological frameworks that govern how we acquire all knowledge.

When the word "God" appears throughout this series, it is not a deistic abstraction. It refers specifically to God as he is revealed in the Bible—the God who speaks, who acts, who dwells with his creation. For the purposes of this argument, the word "transcendent" will be defined as _existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe_. This is a property that belongs distinctly to God.

This series is not intended as a final analysis or an <abbr title="A final demand or statement of terms, the rejection of which may result in a breakdown of relations">ultimatum</abbr>. It is not offered as definitive proof of God's existence. It is, however, an invitation to think carefully about how we know what we know—and what that means for the question of God.

## The Myths We'll Address

There are several claims commonly leveled against belief in God. This series will address them directly:

1. God is a social construct.
2. God is a God of the gaps.
3. Belief in God is irrational, illogical, and unreasonable.
4. Belief in God is for the poorly educated and ignorant.
5. Science and belief in God are incompatible.
6. Due to the plethora of religions, we cannot know precisely who God is.
7. All natural phenomena have natural causes.

These are not <abbr title="Weak or imaginary arguments set up only to be easily refuted; misrepresentations of another's position">strawmen</abbr>. They are positions held by thoughtful people, and they deserve thoughtful responses. By the end of this series, each of these myths will be addressed with evidence and argumentation—not dismissed with <abbr title="The art of persuasive speaking or writing; language designed to have a persuasive or impressive effect">rhetoric</abbr>.

## The Central Question

At the heart of this series is a <abbr title="In a way that gives a misleading impression; appearing simpler than it actually is">deceptively</abbr> simple question: _Can humans invent God?_

The answer to this question has profound implications. If humans can create the concept of a transcendent God through thought alone, then God may indeed be a social construct—a product of human imagination, fear, or wishful thinking. But if humans cannot create transcendent concepts, then our awareness of God must be explained by other means.

This series will demonstrate that human knowledge acquisition operates through two and only two modalities: revelation and reorganization. Revelation is knowledge gained through direct experience with pre-existing realities. Reorganization is the process by which humans leverage revealed properties and behaviors of nature to create new things.

The critical observation is this: reorganization is constrained. Every human invention, every innovation, every abstraction—no matter how sophisticated—operates within the boundaries of the natural order. No human creation has ever exceeded the properties and behaviors of nature. We do not create matter from nothing. We do not <abbr title="To create or establish something; to bring into being as an actual instance">instantiate</abbr> new universes. We do not transcend.

If this is true, then humans cannot create the concept of a transcendent God. We lack the epistemological machinery to do so. And if we cannot create God, then our awareness of him can only be explained one way: God has revealed himself to us.

## What's Coming in This Series

The argument will unfold across twelve posts:

**Posts 2–5** establish the epistemological framework. We will examine how language forms, how thought operates, and how knowledge is acquired. We will define revelation and reorganization precisely, and we will test the limits of human creativity against the constraints of nature. This section <abbr title="Reaching the highest point or final stage; coming to a climax">culminates</abbr> in the central question: can humans invent God?

**Post 6** turns a critical eye toward naturalism. We will examine the circular reasoning embedded in naturalist claims and the limitations of a framework that, by its own definitions, cannot address questions outside its scope.

**Posts 7–8** explore the Biblical record of God's revelation. We will examine how God has made himself known through sensory means—audible voices, visible phenomena—and through spiritual means—dreams, visions, the still small voice. The Hebrew and Greek texts will be consulted to demonstrate the physicality and intentionality of these interactions.

**Posts 9–10** examine the theological implications of revelation. We will explore what it means to be made in the image of God, and we will investigate the concept of the Logos as revealed in John's Gospel—the divine principle of reason and speech through which all things were made.

**Post 11** harmonizes the framework with scientific inquiry. Revelation and reorganization do not oppose naturalism; they explain its explanatory power while accounting for what naturalism cannot address.

**Post 12** draws the threads together. We will revisit each of the seven myths and demonstrate how the framework of revelation and reorganization addresses them. The series concludes not with a demand for belief, but with an invitation to faith grounded in reason.

## A Note on Methodology

This series breaks the artificial barrier between empirical and theological systems. It does so not by abandoning <abbr title="The quality of being extremely thorough and careful; strict precision">rigor</abbr>, but by applying it consistently. The observations presented here are open to revision as new evidence emerges. That is the nature of honest inquiry.

However, until evidence demonstrates that humans can acquire knowledge through means other than revelation and reorganization—or that humans can create constructs that transcend the natural order—the claims in this series remain grounded in observable reality.

The invitation is simple: think carefully, follow the argument, and see where it leads.
