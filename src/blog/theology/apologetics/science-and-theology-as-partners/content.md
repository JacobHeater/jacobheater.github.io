Throughout this series, we have built a framework for understanding how humans acquire knowledge. We have established that there are two modes of knowledge acquisition—revelation and reorganization. We have demonstrated empirically that reorganization is constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature, that no human creation has ever exceeded those constraints, and that therefore humans cannot create transcendent concepts through reorganization alone.

We have also examined the Biblical record of God's revelation to humanity—through both sensory and spiritual means. We have seen that we are made in the image of God, bearing a spiritual capacity to perceive the transcendent. And we have explored the Logos—the divine Word through whom all things were made, who became flesh in the person of Christ.

Now we must address a persistent myth: that science and belief in God are incompatible.

This claim has been repeated so often that many accept it as self-evident. But it is not self-evident. It is not even true. The framework of revelation and reorganization demonstrates not only that science and faith are compatible, but that revelation actually empowers the scientific enterprise. Far from being enemies, science and theology are partners in understanding reality—each addressing questions the other cannot answer.

## The Myth of Incompatibility

The claim that science and belief in God are incompatible rests on several assumptions, most of which collapse under scrutiny.

The first assumption is that science deals with facts while religion deals with feelings or faith. This assumes that religious claims are not factual claims—that they make no assertions about reality that can be examined or tested. But this is manifestly false. The Bible makes numerous claims about reality: that the universe had a beginning, that life was created, that humans possess a unique dignity, that God has interacted with his creation in observable ways. These are not merely feelings. They are assertions about the nature of reality.

The second assumption is that scientific methodology requires naturalism—that science can only operate by assuming all phenomena have natural causes. But this conflates <abbr title="The scientific practice of explaining phenomena only through natural causes, without making claims about whether supernatural causes exist">methodological naturalism</abbr> with <abbr title="The philosophical belief that only natural (as opposed to supernatural) laws and forces operate in the world">metaphysical naturalism</abbr>. Science as a method investigates natural phenomena using natural explanations. This does not require scientists to believe that only natural phenomena exist, or that no phenomena could ever have supernatural causes. The method is not the <abbr title="The branch of philosophy dealing with the fundamental nature of reality and existence">metaphysics</abbr>.

The third assumption is that the success of science in explaining natural phenomena somehow disproves or marginalizes God. But this assumes that God's role is limited to explaining what science cannot—the "God of the gaps." If science explains more, God is pushed into ever-smaller gaps until he disappears entirely. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between God and creation, as we shall see.

## Revelation Empowers Naturalism

The framework of revelation and reorganization does not oppose naturalism within its proper scope. It explains why naturalism works.

There is a hierarchical relationship between what is observed and what is hypothesized. You cannot hypothesize without an impetus to do so. Therefore, the mere action of observing a phenomenon can spawn a series of hypotheses, even if some hypotheses are derived from further observations from derivative events.

The relationship between novel natural phenomena and conscious observers is such that the conscious observer's happening upon novel natural phenomena has nothing to do with the observer's intentions. It has everything to do with the intersection of conscious observers and a sequence of events.

This frame of reference is revelation, fundamentally speaking. The interaction with the natural world can result in unpredictable outcomes. Unpredictability and unfamiliarity are the essence of novelty. Therefore, we can say that in naturalism the hypotheses that are generated about the functions of nature are derived from our embodied experiences with them, not in spite of those experiences. If our intersection with the natural world is either familiar or predictable, this is by definition not novel. Nature tells us about itself through our interactions with it, thus falling in the camp of revelation. <abbr title="An approach that analyzes complex phenomena by breaking them down into simpler, more fundamental parts">Reductionist</abbr> approaches to natural phenomena follow that pattern.

In other words, the scientific method is itself dependent on revelation. Scientists do not create the phenomena they study. They observe phenomena that exist independently of their observation. They discover properties and behaviors of nature that were present before any scientist investigated them. This is revelation—the intersection of a conscious observer with pre-existing realities.

The revelation and reorganization framework does not oppose naturalism. It explains its explanatory power. It gives reason for why naturalism works so well within its scope. And it gives cause to the things that pure empiricism and naturalism cannot explain.

## The Self-Imposed Limits of Naturalism

We have already examined the circular reasoning inherent in naturalist claims. When naturalists assert that all natural phenomena have natural causes, they are making a claim that cannot be verified from within the naturalist framework. The claim presupposes its own terms.

This is not a trivial point. It means that naturalism, by its own definitions, is limited in what it can address. It can investigate natural phenomena using natural explanations. It cannot, by definition, address phenomena that might have causes outside the natural order.

If natural phenomena have natural causes, then naturalism by its very definitions is disqualified from either confirming or denying supernatural conceptualizations because it ignores them entirely. It is not disqualified because it concedes to the supernatural. It is disqualified because it claims ignorance to the supernatural.

This is a self-imposed limitation. Naturalists choose to operate within these constraints. That is their right. But they cannot then claim that their methodology disproves or marginalizes claims that lie outside its scope. That would be like a marine biologist claiming to have disproved the existence of land animals because she has never encountered one in her underwater research.

Science is a powerful tool for investigating the natural world. It is not equipped to <abbr title="To make a formal judgment or decision about a problem or disputed matter">adjudicate</abbr> metaphysical questions about ultimate origins, transcendent beings, or the existence of dimensions beyond the material universe. These questions lie outside its methodological scope. That does not mean they are unanswerable. It means they must be answered by other means.

## The Framework Harmonizes Science and Theology

The revelation and reorganization framework harmonizes the positions of the naturalist and the theist. Its strengths are that it gives reason for the explanatory power and predictability of naturalism, and gives cause to the things that pure empiricism and naturalism cannot explain.

Consider what this framework affirms:

First, it affirms the validity of scientific investigation. Nature has properties and behaviors that can be observed, documented, and utilized. These properties exist independently of human discovery. They can be revealed through careful observation and experimentation. Science is the systematic study of these revealed properties, and it works precisely because nature exhibits consistent, intelligible order.

Second, it affirms the validity of human innovation and technology. Humans can reorganize the properties and behaviors of nature to create new things. The automobile, the airplane, the computer—all of these are products of human ingenuity leveraging natural properties. The framework does not diminish human creativity. It situates it within a larger context.

Third, it affirms the limits of human creation. No human reorganization has ever exceeded the constraints of nature. This is an empirical observation, not a theological assertion. We can verify it by examining every human invention and noting that none creates matter ex nihilo, none transcends the laws of physics, none produces anything that exceeds the properties of its constituent elements.

Fourth, it affirms the existence of realities that lie beyond human creative capacity. If humans cannot create transcendent concepts through reorganization, then our awareness of transcendent realities must come from another source. That source is revelation—God making himself known to us.

This is not God of the gaps. This is God as the foundation that makes the gaps intelligible in the first place.

## Not God of the Gaps

One of the myths addressed in this series is that God is a "God of the gaps"—invoked to explain whatever science has not yet explained, and destined to be pushed out as science advances.

This fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between God and creation. God is not found in the gaps of human understanding. Rather, God is found in the fundamental principles of logic, reason, and rational discourse. God cannot be relegated to the gaps. He is necessarily found in the empirical understanding that humans have no means to create or conceive him through thought alone, and therefore, God can only exist because he has chosen to reveal himself to us.

The God of the gaps fallacy assumes that God's role is explanatory—filling in blanks that science will eventually fill. But the framework of revelation and reorganization positions God differently. God is not a placeholder for scientific ignorance. God is the source of the rational order that makes science possible.

Why is the universe intelligible? Why does it operate according to consistent principles? Why is mathematics effective at describing physical reality? Why can humans—finite beings with limited cognitive capacity—understand the workings of a vast and ancient universe?

The naturalist must treat these as brute facts—fortunate coincidences that require no explanation. The theist has an answer: the universe is intelligible because it was created by a rational God, and we can perceive its intelligibility because we are made in that God's image.

This is not a gap. This is the foundation.

## Empirical Validation of the Framework

Throughout this writing it has been empirically established that there are two modalities for the means of knowledge acquisition—revelation and reorganization. Empirically, it has been validated that revelation fundamentally comes before reorganization. This has been empirically established by observing the formation of language and thought, in that language and words cannot be synthesized in the absence of direct experience primarily before reorganizations of those experiences can occur. It has also been empirically established in that natural properties and behaviors exist even in the absence of human discovery and nomenclature.

Subsequently, it has been established empirically that there is not one single human invention or innovation that does not rely on the properties and behaviors of nature. In the absence of examples to the contrary, it is empirically observable that humans are incapable of creating inventions that exceed the properties and behaviors of nature. In other words, humans are incapable of creating transcendent entities or realities.

This is not theological assertion masquerading as science. This is observation. Look at every human creation. Examine the automobile, the airplane, the smartphone, the space shuttle. Every single one operates within the constraints of natural law. Every single one depends on properties of nature—combustion, friction, electricity, aerodynamics—that humans discovered but did not create.

The implications of this analysis is that humans cannot create God knowing that God, by definition, is transcendent. We can conclude that if humans can create the concept of God, then God isn't transcendent and that, by definition, is not God.

This ultimately leads us to the conclusion of a logical, rational, and empirical validation of the belief in God.

## The Substantive Basis of Faith

The validity of the revelation and reorganization framework is not bound to specific contexts or timeframes. It is validated by the historical record of human innovation and discovery. It is validated by both naturalist and supernatural postures. It harmonizes the positions of the naturalist and the theist.

Furthermore, this framework is inherently not self-referential in that it asserts that there is a continuum between human experience and knowledge acquisition which spans the entire history of human existence and does not constrain itself on fixed scopes.

This distinguishes it from naturalism, which suffers from the circular flaw of defining itself using natural terms. The framework of revelation and reorganization does not define itself using natural terms. When the framework postulates that God has revealed himself to us, it does so from a position that is grounded in a simple observation: humans cannot create transcendent concepts, yet we possess awareness of transcendent realities. Therefore, that awareness must come from outside ourselves.

This is <abbr title="Having a firm basis in reality; meaningful and significant; having substance">substantive</abbr>. It is grounded in observation. It is testable—if someone can demonstrate a human creation that transcends the properties of nature, the framework is falsified. No such demonstration has ever occurred.

## Leaving Room for Faith

While the power of the revelation and reorganization framework is in its self-evident and empirically validated claims, the acceptance of this framework is still a matter of personal belief and choice. The Bible is clear on the right to self-determination, even if that means being wrong. Ultimately, this framework is not intending to replace faith with <abbr title="The philosophical doctrine that all events, including human actions, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will">determinism</abbr>. The intention is to illuminate the logical basis for faith in God.

This is an important point. The framework does not prove God's existence in a way that compels belief. It demonstrates that belief in God is rational, logical, and empirically grounded. But it leaves room for choice.

The correlation of this framework with the God of the Bible is intentional, as it reflects the author's beliefs. However, that alone is not unsubstantiated with evidence from the Bible. The Bible is a unique holy text in that it is the only holy text that makes the case for God dwelling with humans and creating humans in his spiritual likeness. The Bible makes the case for a God that interacts with humans in a sensory fashion and in a spiritual fashion. The Bible makes the case for a God that bestowed upon us the Logos in his likeness, and that is demonstrated in our ability to reorganize nature in intelligible ways.

All of that being said, the responsibility of accepting or denying the Biblical truths that bolster this framework is entirely up to the reader. This writing makes no efforts to coerce the reader into accepting its positions, but it does present a compelling case for them. Ultimately, the role of faith is to accept compelling evidence where no physical evidence can be called upon at will.

## The Necessity of Faith

Given that God is a transcendent God that resides in a dimension that is inaccessible to us by definition, and that only God can choose to move between those dimensions, then our faith in God resides in the acceptance of that fact.

This is not a weakness of the framework. It is an acknowledgment of reality.

Despite the power of the revelation and reorganization framework, God himself is not empirically validatable. Only the fact that he cannot be created is empirically validated. Knowing that we can reason God's existence, however, provides a compelling case for belief in God.

We cannot put God under a microscope. We cannot demand that he appear on command. We cannot design an experiment that forces him to reveal himself. If we could do any of these things, we would have power over God, and that, by definition, would not be God.

Faith is trusting what has been revealed when direct empirical access is not available. This is not blind faith—believing without evidence. This is reasoned faith—accepting the implications of what can be observed and reasoned.

We observe that humans cannot create transcendent concepts. We observe that we possess awareness of transcendent realities. We reason that this awareness must come from revelation. We accept that the source of this revelation is God.

This chain of reasoning does not eliminate faith. It provides a rational foundation for faith. And that is precisely the harmony between science and theology that this framework illuminates.

## True Partnership

Science and faith are not enemies. They are not even uneasy partners who must be kept in separate compartments. They are complementary approaches to understanding reality.

Science investigates the natural world through observation, experimentation, and naturalistic explanation. It excels at answering "how" questions—how does combustion work, how do cells divide, how does gravity operate.

Theology addresses questions that science cannot—questions of ultimate origin, purpose, meaning, and the nature of transcendent reality. It answers "why" questions—why is there something rather than nothing, why is the universe intelligible, why do humans have moral awareness.

The framework of revelation and reorganization shows that both approaches are grounded in the same foundation: the properties and behaviors of a universe created by a rational God, revealed to creatures made in his image.

Science works because nature is consistent and intelligible. Faith is rational because our awareness of the transcendent cannot be explained by our own creative capacity.

This is not warfare. This is harmony.
