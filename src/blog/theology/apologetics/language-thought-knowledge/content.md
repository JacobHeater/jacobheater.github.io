Before we can answer the question of whether humans can invent God, we must first establish how humans acquire knowledge at all. This is not a trivial exercise. The <abbr title="Relating to epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge">epistemological</abbr> foundations we lay here will carry the weight of everything that follows.

Language is the starting point. It is the instrument through which we think, communicate, and preserve knowledge. Understanding how language forms—and what constrains its formation—reveals something fundamental about the limits of human cognition.

## Language as the Basis for Thought

Language is principally a tool for communication among people who hold that language in common. But it is more than that. Language is the mechanism through which we synthesize thought, gain shared understanding, and preserve ideas for <abbr title="All future generations of people; descendants collectively">posterity</abbr>.

There is no clear delineation between the internal monologue of thought and communicated language. Both utilize the same <abbr title="Relating to meaning in language; concerned with the meanings of words and phrases">semantic</abbr> structures. When you think, you are speaking internally. When you speak, you are externalizing thought. The processes are not fundamentally different—only their manifestation differs.

This observation has an important implication. Communicated language, especially in writing, can be understood as a snapshot of consciousness. When an author commits thoughts to paper, they are preserving a record of their internal processes—their word choices, their reasoning, their stream of consciousness. The thought is preserved as long as the artifact endures.

This is how knowledge compounds across generations. Thoughts and knowledge that remain unrecorded are <abbr title="Liable to change rapidly and unpredictably; easily evaporating; unstable">volatile</abbr>. They vanish when the person carrying them passes away. But recorded language persists, allowing subsequent generations to build upon what came before.

## Two Ways Words Are Born

The origins of human language are not well understood empirically, and no attempt will be made here to explain them. However, the _formation_ of language—the way vocabulary comes into existence—is something we can observe and validate through personal experience.

Vocabulary is conjured in two ways: direct experience and invention.

**Direct experience** is the primary and fundamental mode. When we encounter something novel in the world around us, we name it. This is <abbr title="The science or practice of classification; the systematic arrangement of organisms or concepts into categories">taxonomy</abbr>, and humans are remarkably skilled at it. The fields of biology, chemistry, and physics are filled with examples of humans encountering phenomena and assigning names to them. We observe, we categorize, we label. This is how primitive vocabulary forms.

**Invention** is the secondary mode. Humans create names for their own innovations—telephone, computer, automobile, book. These words do not emerge from encountering pre-existing phenomena in nature. They emerge from human ingenuity applied to nature's properties and behaviors.

A third category might seem to exist: words that do not map to specific physical entities. Nonsense words, abstract terms, <abbr title="Newly coined words or expressions; words that have recently entered common use">neologisms</abbr>. But upon examination, these words utilize existing <abbr title="Relating to words or vocabulary; concerning the words of a language">lexical</abbr> structures. They borrow from established vocabulary. They map semantically to existing meanings, often as synonyms or derivatives. They do not manifest as naturally observable phenomena, nor do they possess the power to exist as new physical creations independent of their linguistic components.

Therefore, this third category collapses into the second. Nonsense words and abstract terms reside in the realm of invention—or as this series will refer to it, _reorganization_. They are rearrangements of existing linguistic and conceptual material, not novel creations from nothing.

## The Role of the Senses

What drives direct experience in language formation? The answer is straightforward: the physical senses.

Humans experience the world through sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Assuming no disabilities with these senses—and even accounting for such disabilities, the point is only constrained, not nullified—our sensory apparatus is the interface through which we encounter reality.

When we encounter something for the first time, we are interacting with it through one or more of these sensory modalities. Our consciousness filters this sensory data. A thought forms. Perhaps the initial experience is wonder, or awe, or confusion. At some point in the sequence of events, we attempt to name the phenomenon.

A new word is born.

This process is fundamental. It cannot be bypassed. Language rooted in direct experience is language rooted in sensory interaction with the physical world. The implications of this will become clear as we examine the limits of what humans can create through thought alone.

## Language as a Snapshot of Consciousness

It is accurate to claim that there is no fundamental difference between thought and speech except for their manifestation. Both processes utilize the same cognitive mechanisms. In cases where thought is not yet abstracted into communicative language—such as in infants—other forms of abstraction aid cognition: pattern matching, mathematical intuition, and other coherent methods of reasoning about sensory realities. But as language develops, it becomes the primary vehicle for thought.

Writing extends this principle. When an author commits thoughts to paper, they are preserving a snapshot of their consciousness for future readers. Initial drafts represent something akin to a stream of consciousness. Through revision, the snapshot sharpens. The resolution becomes clearer. But the fundamental nature of the artifact remains: it is a preserved record of thought.

This snapshot is particularly useful for building upon existing knowledge. Perhaps the author is writing about a novel experience—something encountered through direct sensory interaction with the world. Perhaps the author is writing about a new innovation—something constructed from the properties and behaviors of nature. In either case, the written word allows that knowledge to persist beyond the author's lifetime.

This is how human understanding accumulates. We record what we have learned. Others read it, validate or invalidate it, and build upon it. The instrument that makes this possible is language.

## The Foundation Is Sensory

The critical takeaway from this analysis is that language—and therefore thought—is fundamentally grounded in sensory experience with the physical world.

Words born from direct experience are words that name pre-existing realities. We did not create the phenomena; we merely named them. The phenomena existed before our awareness of them, and they would continue to exist in our absence.

Words born from invention are words that name human constructions. But those constructions are themselves built from the properties and behaviors of nature that we have encountered through sensory experience. The telephone exists because we understand the properties of electricity and sound. The automobile exists because we understand combustion, friction, and the behavior of round objects. Invention does not escape the sensory foundation—it builds upon it.

This has profound implications for the question at the heart of this series. If all human knowledge is ultimately grounded in sensory experience with the physical world, then there are constraints on what humans can conceive. We cannot think our way to concepts that have no grounding in experienced reality.

The question becomes: is God such a concept? Can humans, through thought alone, create the concept of a transcendent being that exists apart from and is not subject to the limitations of the material universe?

To answer that question, we must first define the two modalities of knowledge acquisition more precisely. That is the work of the next post.
