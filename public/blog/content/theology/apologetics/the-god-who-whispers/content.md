In the previous post, we examined the Biblical record of God's sensory revelation—how God spoke audibly to Adam, appeared visibly to Moses, answered Job from the whirlwind, and thundered from heaven in ways that engaged the physical senses of those who encountered him. The Hebrew and Greek terms we analyzed confirmed that these were not metaphors or spiritual impressions but genuine sensory experiences.

But sensory revelation is not the only way God has made himself known. Throughout Scripture, we find a parallel mode of divine communication—one that bypasses the physical senses entirely and speaks directly to the spirit. Dreams, visions, and the still small voice represent a distinct category of revelation that demonstrates something critical about both God's nature and our own.

This distinction matters for the framework we have established. If God is transcendent, then he is not limited to the physical realm in his communication with humanity. He can choose to reveal himself through our senses, or he can choose to reveal himself through our spirits. The fact that Scripture documents both modes of revelation supports the transcendent nature of God and points to a dualistic nature within humans themselves.

## The Necessity of Spiritual Revelation

It has been established that God is transcendent—existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe. This transcendence means there is a plane of existence that resides outside of the natural realm. Reason tells us this because we know that God is transcendent, and that dimension in which God exists is immeasurable through empirical means.

Through the validation of the revelation and reorganization framework, we have established that God can only be known through revelation and not reorganization. This necessarily places God in a dimension that resides explicitly outside of the immanent reality we live in—this natural universe where we are clearly constrained by the limits that govern it. We hold no power over it. Yes, we can wield it, but we cannot usurp it.

Given this transcendence, it follows that God would not limit himself to physical means of communication. A transcendent God can move between dimensions at will. He can speak to our ears, and he can speak to our spirits. The Biblical record testifies that he does both.

## Classifying Revelation

Revelation, as we defined before, is knowledge that is acquired by direct experience of the things that we are aware of. The revelations that make themselves known to us exist independent of our awareness of them. Being made in the image of God gives us the ability to discern God's voice, to perceive it. Being that God is transcendent, God reveals himself to us both spiritually and physically.

Therefore, we must classify revelation into two categories—material revelation and spiritual revelation. Being that God is transcendent and we are not, we cannot coerce God to reveal himself in either way. God chooses to reveal himself to us as he chooses.

This classification does not diminish the framework of revelation and reorganization. Rather, it self-evidently needs a bit more nuance for not diminishing the evidently transcendent nature of God. Revelation and reorganization maintain their positions as the two systems through which we gather knowledge, however revelation is self-evidently subdivided into two categories. The framework is strengthened by this clarification, not weakened.

## Jacob's Ladder

One of the most striking examples of spiritual revelation in the Old Testament is Jacob's dream at Bethel.

_'And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it."'_

_Genesis 28:12-16 ESV_

Notice what Jacob says upon waking: "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not know it." Jacob did not perceive God's presence through his physical senses while awake. He was not aware of God until God revealed himself through the dream. This is spiritual revelation—God communicating directly to Jacob's spirit while his physical senses were dormant in sleep.

The content of the dream was not vague or symbolic in a way that required interpretation. God spoke clearly. He identified himself. He made specific promises. This was not the random firing of neurons during REM sleep. This was the transcendent God choosing to reveal himself through spiritual means.

## Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar

The entirety of Daniel chapter 2 demonstrates the power and purpose of spiritual revelation. King Nebuchadnezzar received a dream from God—a dream so troubling that he demanded his wise men not only interpret it but tell him what the dream was without him first describing it.

This was an impossible task for human wisdom. The wise men of Babylon correctly understood this when they said, "There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand... none can show it to the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh" (Daniel 2:10-11 ESV).

Daniel, however, received the interpretation through additional spiritual revelation. The mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Notice the chain: God revealed the dream to Nebuchadnezzar spiritually, and God revealed the interpretation to Daniel spiritually. Both revelations bypassed the physical senses entirely.

This demonstrates that spiritual revelation is not a lesser form of communication. It can convey precise information, future events, and divine purposes. It is simply a different mode by which the transcendent God chooses to interact with his creation.

## Joseph's Dream

The New Testament continues this pattern of spiritual revelation. Consider the announcement to Joseph regarding Mary's pregnancy.

_'But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."'_

_Matthew 1:20-21 ESV_

Joseph did not see the angel with his physical eyes. He did not hear an audible voice. The angel appeared to him in a dream—a spiritual mode of revelation. Yet the message was clear, specific, and actionable. Joseph knew exactly what he was being told and what he was supposed to do.

This continues the pattern we see throughout Scripture. God is not limited to one mode of communication. He can thunder from heaven, and he can whisper in dreams. The transcendent God chooses his method based on his purposes, not based on any limitation.

## The Still Small Voice

Perhaps the most instructive passage for understanding spiritual revelation is Elijah's encounter with God at Horeb. After his victory over the prophets of Baal and his subsequent flight from Jezebel, Elijah found himself in a cave on the mountain of God.

_'And he said, "Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord." And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.'_

_1 Kings 19:11-12 ESV_

The King James Version renders the final phrase as "a still small voice." Let's examine the Hebrew terms. According to Strong's Concordance:

"Still" is found in [H1827](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/1827.html):

**Strong's #1827:** _dmamah_ (pronounced dem-aw-maw')

_feminine from 1826; quiet:--calm, silence, still._

"Small" is found in [H1851](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/1851.html):

**Strong's #1851:** _daq_ (pronounced dak)

_from 1854; crushed, i.e. (by implication) small or thin:--dwarf, lean(-fleshed), very little thing, small, thin._

"Voice" is the familiar [H6963](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/6963.html):

**Strong's #6963:** _qowl_ (pronounced kole)

_or qol {kole}; from an unused root meaning to call aloud; a voice or sound:--+ aloud, bleating, crackling, cry (+ out), fame, lightness, lowing, noise, + hold peace, (pro-)claim, proclamation, + sing, sound, + spark, thunder(-ing), voice, + yell._

The contrast in this passage is critical. God was not in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire—dramatic sensory phenomena that could be perceived physically. God spoke in the _dmamah daq qowl_—the quiet, thin, small voice. This is a distinctly different mode of communication from the thundering voice at Sinai or the audible call from the burning bush.

This passage demonstrates that God can choose to communicate in ways that are barely perceptible to the physical senses, if at all. The still small voice speaks to Elijah's spirit more than to his ears.

## Visions of the Night

The book of Job records another example of spiritual revelation that illuminates the nature of this communication.

_'"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it. Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up."'_

_Job 4:12-15 ESV_

Notice the language: the word was brought "stealthily." It was a "whisper." It came amid "visions of the night" when "deep sleep falls on men." This is spiritual revelation—communication that bypasses normal sensory channels and speaks directly to the human spirit.

The physical effects described—trembling, shaking bones, hair standing on end—indicate that spiritual revelation can produce physical responses. But the communication itself is not through the physical senses. It is spirit to spirit.

## Peter and Cornelius

The book of Acts provides two parallel examples of spiritual revelation that demonstrate how God orchestrates his purposes through this mode of communication.

_'About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, "Cornelius." And he stared at him in terror and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea." When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him, and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.'_

_Acts 10:3-8 ESV_

While Cornelius's messengers were on their way, Peter received his own spiritual revelation:

_'And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. And there came a voice to him: "Rise, Peter; kill and eat." But Peter said, "By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has made clean, do not call common." This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.'_

_Acts 10:10-16 ESV_

Peter fell into a trance. He saw a vision. He heard a voice. But none of this was occurring through his normal physical senses. He was in an altered state of consciousness where God could communicate directly with his spirit.

The coordination of these two revelations—Cornelius receiving instructions to send for Peter while Peter received preparation for Cornelius's messengers—demonstrates the purposeful nature of spiritual revelation. God orchestrates his plans through both sensory and spiritual means as he chooses.

## The Dualistic Nature of Humans

These documented cases of spiritual revelation point to something profound about human nature. Humans, being uniquely made in the image of God, are able to perceive God because God uniquely created us in his likeness. This doesn't mean that we are God, but we have a unique connection to our creator in that we bear his likeness. This is a spiritual connection to our creator.

God chose humans to bear his likeness, and since God is transcendent, then we bear the ability to perceive the transcendent. This is necessarily so because we cannot reorganize natural phenomena to create God, but we have an awareness of him, and God sometimes chooses to reveal himself to us through physical means, but many documented cases exist where God communicates with his creation through spiritual means.

This dualistic nature—the capacity to perceive both material and spiritual revelation—is itself evidence of God's design. Why would humans have the capacity for spiritual perception if there were nothing spiritual to perceive? The naturalist cannot account for this capacity without invoking natural causality, yet the existence of spiritual awareness defies purely material explanation.

## Spiritual Awareness and Perception

The fact that some people in the audience could perceive God's thundering voice and some could not indicates that spiritual awareness is present in some and not in others. Consider the passage from John's Gospel where a voice came from heaven:

_'Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven: "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."'_

_John 12:28-29 ESV_

Some heard thunder. Others heard an angel. Jesus heard his Father. The same phenomenon was perceived differently by different people based on their spiritual awareness. This supports the claim that humans have varying capacities for spiritual perception—a capacity that makes no sense in a purely material universe but makes perfect sense if we are made in the image of a transcendent God.

## God Chooses His Method

In these passages, God communicates with his creation through dreams, visions, and an inner voice, which is a distinct difference from the audible nature of God's booming voice in audiences where they are documented as having heard it through a thundering sound. This supports the dualistic nature, and more importantly, the transcendent nature through which God can choose how he wants to communicate with humanity.

This demonstrates that God is not limited to the physical realm to communicate with humans, and he ultimately chooses how he communicates with us. We cannot demand that God appear in fire. We cannot command him to speak audibly. We cannot coerce spiritual visions. God reveals himself as he chooses, through the means he chooses, to the people he chooses.

This is consistent with what we established earlier about revelation. The revelation of God to us is not something we control. It is not the product of our seeking, though we are invited to seek. It is the decision of a transcendent God to make himself known to his creation. Whether through the thunder at Sinai or the whisper at Horeb, through the burning bush or the dream in the night, God initiates. We respond.

The Biblical record of spiritual revelation—dreams, visions, trances, and the still small voice—confirms that we are more than material beings. We have a spiritual dimension that can perceive a transcendent God. This dualistic nature, combined with our documented inability to create transcendent concepts through reorganization, points to a creator who made us in his image—with the capacity to know him.
