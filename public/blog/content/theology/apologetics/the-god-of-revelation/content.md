![An Image of Revelation](__blogpath__/revelation.png)

In this entry, we'll start by defining the term `revelation` and look at the more fundamental linguistic components of the word _revelation_. We'll use that grounding to establish the contexts in which it is not just appropriate to, but necessary to apply the meaning of the word revelation as it relates to acquiring knowledge. With those contexts in mind, we'll determine the pathways from revelation by which humans can gain new insights into the world around us—in all the ways that knowledge can be revealed to us. By the end of this entry, we will have a good understanding of how revelation empowers the human mind to learn, adapt, grow, and understand our place in God's creation.

### Fundamentals

The verb and noun forms—_reveal_ and _revelation_—both come from the Latin **revelare**, which indicates the strong link between the Latin word and the English word _reveal_. According to [latin-dictionary.net](https://www.latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/revelare), _revelare_ means:

> **Revelare**
> verb
> conjugation: 1st conjugation
>
> 1. To reveal
> 2. To show

💡 This leads us to the verb `reveal`.

According to _The Century Dictionary_, the word **reveal** means:

> To discover; expose to sight, recognition, or understanding; disclose; divulge; make known.
> Specifically: To disclose as religious truth; divulge by supernatural means; make known by divine agency.
> In metaphysics: To afford an immediate knowledge of.
> Synonyms: To unveil, uncover, communicate, show, impart.

### Conclusions

If to _reveal_ means to discover, or to gain understanding of something, the proper context in which to apply the word _reveal_ is not exclusively a religious context, although this word has to some degree been heavily contextualized to religious applications. Even still, revelation is not purely a religious phenomenon. In fact, revelation is the starting point of all knowledge acquisition. Let's look at some examples to test this position.

## Application

---

### Scientific Discovery

In the context of scientific discovery, revelation plays a central role. It's worth pausing here to clarify what might seem like a subtle distinction: some might ask, "Isn’t that just learning?" But what is learning, if not the movement from ignorance to knowledge? To learn something is to come to know what was once unknown. That is revelation. Revelation is not limited to divine pronouncements or supernatural events. It is any moment where truth is disclosed—when what was hidden becomes seen, when what was confusing becomes clear. In this sense, all genuine learning is revelatory. More importantly, the entry point to hypothesizing is not esoteric understanding, but curiosity and an observant mind. To ask questions does not require a foundation of expansive knowledge, but simply wanting to know how something functions. Let's look at some examples.

1. A bird takes flight.
2. A rainbow appears in the sky.
3. Precipitation takes many forms (rain, snow, etc.).

You may take for granted the well-established breadth of knowledge that now explains these phenomena in ways that demystify them. However, there was a time when the functions of these phenomena were the subject of sincere scientific study.

The thing that unifies these things together in this context is not their manifestation, but our **awareness** of them. These things happen independently in functions independent of each other. Yet, our awareness of these things is what allows us to study them. The **observation** of these phenomena, indeed the **discovery** of these phenomena are what presents the questions.

1. How does a bird fly?
2. How does a rainbow appear in the sky?
3. How does precipitation take many forms?

The investigation into these phenomena is exactly what allows us to discover how they work. Is it our understanding of how these phenomena function that allows them to be so? We can reject with certainty that such a claim is patently false, for it was the bird that flew into our view, and the rainbow that caught our attention with its brilliance, and the rain, snow, and/or sleet that fell before our eyes. To suggest otherwise would put our sensory awareness at the center of natural phenomena. Yet, we know this not to be the case because we share a reality with a plethora of conscious observers, who all simultaneously share in our discovery.

When we look into how the bird flies, or how the rainbow appears, or the source of precipitation, nature tells us about itself. It is through the depths of discovery, curiosity, hypothesis, and testing that we gain an understanding of how nature works. It is by these means of understanding that we acquire knowledge through empiricism. It is not by our understanding that nature functions. Therefore, nature is making itself known to us.

### Divinity

We discussed in the [last entry](/blog/theology/can-humans-invent-god) that humans could not have invented God in any capacity whether as an individual invention, or a social construct because when considering all abstract or concrete inventions, the characteristics that are attributed to God are unlike anything that humans have ever invented. Thus, the claim that humans invented God being truly unique falls under a logical fallacy called special pleading.

Therefore, in the context of divinity, revelation applies to God's self-disclosure to humans. The God of the Bible is described with characteristics that demonstrate a unique ability to move between physical and spiritual dimensions. God, principally, is transcendent in that He is unlike anything in nature — His characteristics transcend His creation. Humans clearly lack the ability to transcend nature, or move beyond the physical dimension that we live in, yet we have awareness of God. We must conclude, then, that our awareness of Him is not because we have moved to God, but that God came to us in His lovingkindness.

In Genesis, God is described as the author of all reality. Yet, in just a couple chapters after He created the heavens and the Earth, we see that God interacts with His creation in tangible ways that demonstrate His ability to move between dimensions of physical and spirit.

> And they heard the `sound` of the Lord God `walking` in the garden in the cool of the day,
> and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the
> trees of the garden.
>
> [Genesis 3:8](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.3.8)

It cannot be for our awareness that God exists because we know that our awareness does not bring anything into reality. Humans cannot simply, by our awareness, bring anything into reality. That specifically sounds like a divine attribute. Contrarily, our awareness allows us to understand the mechanics and produce replicas at best. But, novelty in the truest, most fundamental sense, is a divine attribute. To know God means that God must come to us, because we have awareness of Him, yet cannot go to Him. Therefore, God must have come to us.

#### Participating in God's Creation

God gave us our awareness, our consciousness. It is in this uniqueness of our consciousness that we are able to observe, study, learn, adapt, replicate, invent, innovate, and do so much more. It is, perhaps, what makes us so distinct in all of God's creation. In fact, in Genesis, God says we **are** different.

> Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

It is in this uniqueness that we can see that God designed for us to be in a superior relationship to His created nature, but inferior to God Himself. Nonetheless, humans have a really special role in God's creation. We can see from the beginning that God intended for humans to use their awareness to support nature, to nurture it, to establish ourselves as caretakers of His creation.

> Now out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see `what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name`. The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him.

> [Genesis 2:19–20](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.2.19-20)

Our awareness does not make the animals exist, but God gave humanity a special job! We had the job of naming His creation. We can see that God gave us a role to play in our consciousness. Being made in His image means we bear the likeness of God. We have a very important role to play. Clearly, however, the limitations of our responsibilities were never to be creators of realities, or instantiators of matter, or bearers of novelty. No, these are the responsibility of God. It is in our inferiority that we were meant to be stewards of God's creation, and to be stewards means that we must study the creation, and learn about the creation. This is something that through the scientific endeavor that we still do today. We are still playing the role of stewards of God's creation.

## Conclusion

---

Revelation cannot be an exclusive term to theology or divinity. Every new thing we come to know is revealed to us.
Nature reveals itself to us all the time. Every interaction we have with the world around us that leads us to new understanding is a revelation. All scientific discovery is revelation. All genuine understanding is revealed through exploration. God's creation was always meant to be studied. We are still students of His creation, and it is through this study that we continue to learn and grow.

Reason leads us to know that our awareness does not manifest reality. Contrarily, God's nature, the reality that He made and that we dwell in reveals itself to us when we inquire of it with curiosity and openness. In like ways, God does the same. When we inquire of God, He will reveal Himself to us faithfully. We can trust that He will since He first revealed Himself to us. We didn't even have to inquire of Him. He came to us faithfully as the Creator. How much more will He reveal Himself to us when we turn our attention to Him. After all, that really is what worship is, and that is all that God requires of us. In your worship, He will reveal Himself to you.
