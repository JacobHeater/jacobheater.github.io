In the [previous](/blog/theology/apologetics/the-god-of-revelation) blog entry,
we dissected the claim that God could be a product of the human mind,
measured that assertion against all possible products of the mind, and found
that God is a unique entry in the bank of knowledge. From that, we discovered
that the assertion that God is a product of the mind is a case of the logical
fallacy _special pleading_, and because it starts from a fallacious premise,
the conclusions are invalid.

After uncovering the fallacy in the assertion, we explored _how_ humans
could have any awareness of God at all. We examined the concept of _revelation_
as it relates to acquiring knowledge and debunked the myth that revelation
is a term reserved only for religious contexts. It is by revelation
that we come to know precisely how humans could conceive of God.

In this blog entry, we will look more closely at the products of the
human mind, and how we acquire knowledge to arrange God's creation
in new ways. Through this reorganization, we come up
with novel ways to leverage God's creation for our benefit, and hopefully
care for and enhance life on Earth, our temporary home. By the end of this
blog, we will see that there are really only two modes for humans to
acquire knowledge: revelation and reorganization. We will test various
entries in the bank of human knowledge to discern which category the knowledge
falls into—revelation or reorganization.

If you haven't yet, now would be a good time to read the previous entry.
It will help orient you to the terms we are about to discuss.

## Preface

To clarify, these terms are my own and do not represent
a broader academic phraseology for the modes of knowledge acquisition. That
being said, the concepts I use to describe these aspects of human knowledge
are not unique to me. They are well documented in cognitive sciences. I will not
elaborate on those sciences here, but if you're interested in background concepts
and science, please read up on `Embodied Cognition.`

## Reorganization

Reorganization is the second in the binary system of acquiring knowledge that I’m putting forward. It is second because it depends on and is predicated upon revelation. Revelation is the process by which information is disclosed to the observer—something we encounter, discover, or recognize. Reorganization comes after that. It involves taking what has been revealed and, through discovery and hypothesis, testing new arrangements of the properties, behaviors, and attributes of that information.

A terse example of this is the automobile. By discovering the flammable properties of gasoline and the force it generates, we were able to combine that with the behaviors of propulsion, kinetic energy, and reduced friction in round objects to produce a vehicle.

A second example is the computer. By studying how current flows, how metals conduct, and how electricity can be manipulated through circuitry, we’ve found ways to serialize data digitally—again, all based on information first revealed to us through the properties of the physical world.

By manipulating the information that nature reveals to us in novel ways, humans can
participate in God's creation by acting on the things that we learn from nature to create
things. In this sense, we are not creators of new realities. Contrarily, we operate
within the reality we live to create things within this space. This is precisely
what differentiates us from God. God created the materials, and humans create novel
representations of the materials. The materials don't change in some alchemical fashion.
There's no means to turn silver into gold. There's no means to turn rubies into
diamonds. Gold will be gold, and silver will be silver. Rubies will be rubies
and diamonds will be diamonds. The best we can do is to alter their shape, the form,
or integration with other materials.

## Clear Dependency

Reorganization depends on revelation. We know this because we cannot act on the material
we're working with to create something without first understanding the object's properties,
behaviors, and attributes. We wouldn't know that gasoline was flammable unless we observed
it being ignited. How would we know that steam can be used to power an engine without first
observing the force that it generates?

The ideas for these novel representations of God's creation don't arise spontaneously. God
made us to observe, to learn, to study, to grow, and to participate in His creation. This
is what makes humans distinct in God's creation. We have the capacity to use God's creation
in ways that glorify Him, that please Him, and in ways that steward His creation. Sadly,
we also, in our sinful state, often use God's creation to harm each other or His creation.

We don't assign nature its utility, nor do we compel God's creation to reveal
itself to us. We simply observe it. God made us for this very purpose.

## It All Started In The Garden

From the beginning, God called us into service in His garden as caretakers. He
commissioned us to care for His creation. It's a very special job, and one that is
uniquely assigned to us.

> And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
>
> [Genesis 1:28-31](https://www.bible.com/bible/59/GEN.1.28-31)

It is not by accident that humanity has power over the things that God has given us.
He actually gave us the power over His creation, and the commission to care for it,
and to make ourselves useful with it. You and I were created with a purpose to love
God's creation, care for it, and make each other more fruitful with it.

## Limitations to Reorganization

Despite our commission to steward God's creation, it is clear that God never intended for us
to be gods. We don't create alternate realities, or through our very word bring new matter
into existence. This doesn't require a mental leap to accept. There is no human invention
that escapes its natural confines, nor exceeds the properties, behavior, or attributes
that it was derived from. The limits of reorganization are clear. We can reorganize God's
creation into new patterns in ways that make it more useful than it is otherwise in its
raw state, but we cannot materially alter it in a fundamental way.

## Discerning Revelation and Reorganization

How do we know when something in the catalogue of human knowledge is revelation or reorganization?
It’s actually quite simple: Is the information known by discovery or by assembly?
Information that is revealed is known through discovery—it cannot be explained by human intervention. It’s uncovered, not constructed.
Information that is reorganized cannot exist without its raw material. It is assembled from what has already been revealed.
The key distinction between these two modes of knowledge acquisition comes down to this:
Can the information be attributed to human intervention—or not?

Some examples will help to test this hypothesis.
| Example | Category | Explanation |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The laws of physics | Revelation | Clearly not invented, but observed and experienced.  |
| Perfect geometric forms| Reorganization | Derived from more fundamental math, and cannot exist without its fundamental components, but fundamental math can exist without it.  |
| Unicorns | Reorganization | An obvious combination of horses and horned animals.  |
| Computers | Reorganization | Cannot exist without its fundamental components of electricity, conductivity, and circuitry, but the inverse is not true.  |
| The knowledge of God | Revelation | Allegedly, detractors say we combine multiple concepts to make God. God can exist without those attributes as the source, but they cannot exist without God. |
| Abstract mathematics | Reorganization | A derivative of mathematics. Cannot exist without more fundamental components, but the fundamental components can exist without it.  |


The beautiful thing about this system is that you can *literally* test this against
the `entirety` of human knowledge. It's a results-oriented, results-driven process
of testing the binary knowledge framework. It's not strictly a hypothetical system 
explaining how things might become part of the human knowledge base. It is a process
and an observation.

## The Mind Is Powerful

Clearly the human mind is capable of some pretty amazing things. We have a long
history of invention to draw from that shows the ingenuity of the mind. Most
of our inventions are intended to improve the quality of life on Earth for all.
As Christians, it is important to wield this power of the mind in ways that
point people to Christ. Our inventions should build, and not destroy; should
help and not hurt. In the spirit of stewardship, our role is to make God's
creation provide for all life. It's not just a nice-to-have. You and I were
commissioned through God's design for this very purpose. Don't squander it.

## Conclusions

Reorganization is a powerful tool. God created us with the responsibility to
maintain His creation and keep it in a state that bears fruit for all things
that inhabit this Earth. Our minds are powerful, indeed, but they are finite.
We can construct amazing things from God's resources, but we cannot and do not
have claim to true novelty. Our inventions are mere reflections of God's
creation. In our study, we can see that the mind can invent some pretty amazing
things, but it most certainly cannot invent the raw material. We serve a God who
can and does have that power. God does not need us to exist, and He can
exist without us, without His raw material. I feel honored that God called us
into such a deep responsibility to participate in His creation. Let's do the
most good with it.

Thanks for reading!
