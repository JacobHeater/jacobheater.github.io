In the previous post, we established that language is the foundation of thought and that vocabulary forms in two ways: direct experience and invention. We observed that all language—and therefore all thought—is ultimately grounded in sensory experience with the physical world.

Now we must formalize this observation into a framework. Knowledge acquisition, I will argue, operates through two and only two modalities: revelation and reorganization. Understanding the relationship between these two modalities—and the constraints that govern them—is essential to answering the central question of this series.

## What Is Revelation?

Revelation is the fundamental coincidence of a conscious observer and an observable entity intersecting at a shared point in time and space within a probability space. This intersection allows for the acquisition of knowledge about pre-existing entities, phenomena, or truths in the natural world through direct observation, perception, or experience.

This process is not limited to the scientific realm. Revelation occurs in personal experiences, chance encounters, and unexpected discoveries. When a birdwatcher happens upon a previously undocumented species, revelation has occurred. The birdwatcher—the conscious observer—was in the right place at the right time to perceive the bird—the observable entity—through their senses. The birdwatcher may document this revelation through photographs or recordings, but the bird existed before the encounter. The birdwatcher did not create the bird; the birdwatcher merely became aware of it.

Similarly, when a scientist discovers a new element, revelation has occurred. The scientist observes and documents the element's existence through instruments, recording its properties for others to verify. But the element's properties existed before the scientist's awareness of them. The scientist's hypothesis did not alter this fundamental aspect of revelation. Rather, it was the revealed properties and behaviors of nature that ultimately confirmed or denied the scientist's prior assumptions.

In essence, revelation is the disclosure of something previously unknown, arising from the intersection of consciousness and the observable world. It serves as the foundation for our understanding of reality.

Historically, these coincidental intersections have allowed humans to record the attributes and behaviors of the natural world. Through observation and experimentation, we have discovered that certain metals are more malleable than others, some rocks are more fragile than others, water freezes and boils at specific temperatures, and clay hardens when baked. These revelations have been passed down through oral tradition and written language, enabling subsequent generations to leverage and utilize these properties.

The critical point is this: these behaviors and attributes of nature exist independently of human discovery. Our revelations merely uncover what was already present. The intersection of human consciousness with the natural world allows us to unveil hidden truths, but we do not create those truths through our awareness of them.

## The Revelation of Emergence

Before moving to reorganization, it is necessary to address a phenomenon that might appear to complicate this framework: emergence.

Emergence is a phenomenon in which a complex system exhibits properties, behaviors, or patterns that are not present in its individual components but arise from their interactions and relationships. These emergent properties are often novel, unpredictable, and qualitatively different from the properties of the individual components.

The empirical observation of these properties, behaviors, or patterns fits within revelation. Their existence or instantiation is not the result of our observation, which makes the phenomena explicitly revealed to us. As we explore these complex systems, we may reduce their constituent parts, name the processes that govern them, understand the intricate ways in which they work, and utilize existing knowledge to perform experiments. But our understanding does not create the emergent properties; it merely uncovers them.

Emergence, therefore, is distinctly not a reorganization. The existence of emergent systems or properties is not predicated on our understanding of them. Even in cases where emergent systems arise from human invention, the awareness of these new complex systems is observed, and most definitely is not by design. Were it by design, that would fundamentally not be emergent because the complexity that arises from those constituent components would be planned, and we would clearly understand their instantiation from the outset.

A distinct characteristic of emergent systems is that their properties, behaviors, or patterns are not understood based on the properties of their components alone. Therefore, by categorization, emergence is a revelation.

## What Is Reorganization?

Reorganization is the second modality of knowledge acquisition, and it is dependent on revelation. Reorganization allows humans to take the revealed or discovered attributes and behaviors of the natural universe and leverage them to our benefit.

Reorganization is uniquely a construct of human consciousness. It has no means of creating new behaviors and attributes of nature. It has no means of exceeding the physical constraints of nature. All human invention and innovation is the product of nature's behaviors and attributes, recombined and repurposed by human ingenuity.

Reorganization is often the amalgamation of several properties or behaviors of nature that form a composite system. These composite systems leverage natural behaviors and attributes in new ways. Reorganizations are always instantiated by human thought, but the fundamental elements of them are not.

Consider the automobile. It would not function in the absence of combustion to provide force to power the transmission. Combustion relies on the flammable properties of gasoline. The force generated by the engine would be lost quickly without round tires that roll efficiently. All of these attributes—combustion, flammability, the behavior of round objects—are properties of nature that humans have discovered through revelation. The automobile is a reorganization of these revealed properties into a composite system that serves human purposes.

But humans did not grant the flammable attributes to gasoline. Humans do not govern the principle that round things roll better than jagged things. These are revealed properties of nature. The automobile leverages them; it does not create them.

Consider the airplane. It also relies on combustion, but it adds another layer: knowledge of aerodynamics. The efficient use of energy in flight requires that the airplane encounter minimal resistance while in the air. Smooth surfaces glide better than rough ones. This is not a principle that humans invented; it is a principle that humans discovered. The airplane reorganizes these revealed properties—combustion, aerodynamics, material strength—into a system capable of flight.

In the same way that humans do not govern the principles of friction between round and jagged things, they do not grant smooth surfaces the ability to glide better in the air with less resistance. These are revealed properties of nature. The airplane leverages them; it does not create them.

## The Dependency Relationship

The relationship between revelation and reorganization is hierarchical. Reorganization cannot occur without prior revelation. You cannot leverage properties of nature that you have not first discovered.

This dependency is not merely logical; it is observable. Every human invention relies on properties of nature that were revealed before the invention was conceived. The wheel relies on the revealed behavior of round objects. The forge relies on the revealed properties of heat and metal. The computer relies on the revealed properties of electricity and semiconductors.

As a matter of observation and testing through empirical means, we can conclude that reorganization—being an amalgamation of revealed properties and behaviors of natural resources, and all reorganizations being instantiated by human thought—is absolutely constrained by the properties and behaviors of the natural universe.

As a matter of accruing knowledge, we can state that reorganization as a human construct is incapable of generating creations that exceed the behaviors and attributes of nature or its laws.

This is a critical observation. If reorganization is constrained by the properties of nature, then there are limits to what humans can create. The question that follows is whether those limits extend to the conceptual realm. Can humans, through reorganization, create concepts that transcend the natural order?

That is the question we will address in the next post.
