We have established that humans are made in the image of God—bearing a spiritual resemblance to our creator that gives us the unique capacity to perceive him. This explains why we can receive revelation at all. We are designed for it. But being made in God's image does not make us God. We remain finite, limited, constrained by the properties and behaviors of the natural order. We can perceive transcendence, but we cannot create it.

This distinction between human creative capacity and divine creative capacity lies at the heart of the revelation and reorganization framework. And nowhere is this distinction more clearly illuminated than in the Biblical concept of the Logos—the Word of God revealed in the person of Jesus Christ.

The Logos is not merely a theological abstraction. It is the key to understanding the relationship between thought, speech, creation, and the fundamental intelligibility of the universe. It explains why humans can reorganize the natural order in coherent ways while remaining utterly incapable of transcending it. And it reveals the divine origin of our creative capacity as a reflection—limited but real—of our creator's own nature.

## The Revelation of the Logos

In the gospel of John, Jesus is revealed to the reader as the Logos. This is one of the most profound theological declarations in all of Scripture.

_'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.'_

_John 1:1-5 ESV_

Let's examine the key terms. According to Strong's Concordance entry [G3056](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/3056.html):

**Strong's #3056:** _logos_ (pronounced log'-os)

_from 3004; something said (including the thought); by implication, a topic (subject of discourse), also reasoning (the mental faculty) or motive; by extension, a computation; specially, (with the article in John) the Divine Expression (i.e. Christ):--account, cause, communication, X concerning, doctrine, fame, X have to do, intent, matter, mouth, preaching, question, reason, + reckon, remove, say(-ing), shew, X speaker, speech, talk, thing, + none of these things move me, tidings, treatise, utterance, word, work._

"God" in this passage is [G2316](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2316.html):

**Strong's #2316:** _theos_ (pronounced theh'-os)

_of uncertain affinity; a deity, especially (with 3588) the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very:--X exceeding, God, god(-ly, -ward)._

The Strong's Concordance reveals the richness of the term _logos_. It encompasses thought, speech, reasoning, communication, and expression. It is not merely a word in the sense of a unit of vocabulary. It is the entire process of rational expression—the thought that precedes speech, the speech that expresses thought, and the reason that underlies both.

John identifies Christ as the Logos—the Divine Expression. This is not a metaphor. It is a declaration of identity. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.

## The Pre-Existence of the Logos

John establishes something critical about the relationship between the Logos and Greek philosophical thought. The concept of the Logos did not originate with John or with Christianity. It emerged in <abbr title="Relating to Greek philosophers who lived before Socrates (before 470-399 BC); the earliest period of ancient Greek philosophy">pre-Socratic</abbr> Greek philosophy in the 6th and 5th centuries BC.

A definition emerges from that philosophical tradition: Logos is the fundamental principle of reason, <abbr title="Relating to the universe or cosmos; vast in extent or significance">cosmic</abbr> order, and <abbr title="Capable of being understood through reason or logic">intelligible</abbr> discourse that permeates the universe and human thought.

The Greek philosophers recognized that the universe exhibits rational order. It is intelligible. It operates according to principles that can be understood through reason. They called this underlying rational principle the Logos.

John does something remarkable with this concept. He does not reject the Greek philosophical insight that the universe exhibits rational order. Instead, he reveals the source of that order. The Logos that permeates the universe is not an abstract principle. It is a person. And that person is Christ.

This is revelation, not reorganization. John is not constructing a new philosophical system from existing concepts. He is disclosing something that was hidden—the identity and nature of the cosmic principle that the philosophers had dimly perceived. The Logos is Christ. Christ is the Logos. All things were made through him.

## Speaking Things Into Existence From Nothing

The connection between the Logos and creation is explicit in John's <abbr title="An introductory section of a literary work; the opening part of a book or chapter">prologue</abbr>: "All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." This echoes and illuminates the Genesis account of creation.

In Genesis, God creates through speech. Let's look at the pattern:

_'And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth." And it was so. And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years." And God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens." And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so. Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."'_

_Genesis 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26 ESV_

The repetition is deliberate. God said. And it was so. Creation occurs through divine speech. The Logos—the Word—is the instrument of creation.

God speaks things into existence from the void. The condition of the earth before creation is described in terms that convey absolute emptiness:

_'The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.'_

_Genesis 1:2 ESV_

"Without form" is [H8414](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/8414.html):

**Strong's #8414:** _tohuw_ (pronounced to'-hoo)

_from an unused root meaning to lie waste; a <abbr title="A state of complete emptiness or destruction; devastation">desolation</abbr> (of surface), i.e. desert; figuratively, a worthless thing; adverbially, in vain:--confusion, empty place, without form, nothing, (thing of) nought, vain, vanity, waste, wilderness._

"Void" is [H922](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/922.html):

**Strong's #922:** _bohuw_ (pronounced bo'-hoo)

_from an unused root (meaning to be empty); a <abbr title="Emptiness; lack of content or meaning">vacuity</abbr>, i.e. (superficially) an undistinguishable ruin:--emptiness, void._

God speaks, and from _tohuw_ and _bohuw_—from formlessness and emptiness, from nothing—creation emerges. This is the creative power of the divine Logos. God speaks things into existence ex nihilo—from nothing.

## Speaking Things Into Existence From Something

This is precisely where the distinction between divine creation and human reorganization becomes clear.

God speaks things into existence from nothing. Humans speak things into existence from something.

Through the concept of revelation and reorganization, we can see that God's ability to speak something into existence from nothing is unique to our transcendent creator. However, we also see that God grants humans the ability to leverage the properties and behaviors of nature to our advantage. God commands us to be fruitful and multiply.

_'And God blessed them. And God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."'_

_Genesis 1:28 ESV_

"Fruitful" is [H6509](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/6509.html):

**Strong's #6509:** _parah_ (pronounced paw-raw')

_a primitive root; to bear fruit (literally or figuratively):--bear, bring forth (fruit), (be, cause to be, make) fruitful, grow, increase._

"Multiply" is [H7235](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/hebrew/7235.html):

**Strong's #7235:** _rabah_ (pronounced raw-baw')

_a primitive root; to increase (in whatever respect):--(bring in) abundance (X -antly), + archer (by mistake for 7232), be in authority, bring up, X continue, enlarge, excel, exceeding(-ly), be full of, (be, make) great(-er, -ly, X -ness), grow up, heap, increase, be long, (be, give, have, make, use) many (a time), (any, be, give, give the, have) more (in number), (ask, be, be so, gather, over, take, yield) much (greater, more), (make to) multiply, nourish, plenty(-eous), X process (of time), sore, store, thoroughly, very._

This command from God instructs humans to use the properties and behaviors of nature that we live in to our benefit—to utilize God's resources efficiently. Notice that God never grants us the permission to become mini-gods that can usurp nature and create new universes.

From the very outset in Genesis we can see that God only gives us the ability to reorganize nature in ways that we can be fruitful from. This means we cannot transcend the natural order. However, more importantly is the same Logos that God used to speak things into existence is the same Logos that is within each and every person to reorganize nature to our advantage.

## The Logos Within Us

There is no fundamental difference between speech and thought. Thought is internal speech. We established this early in this series when we examined the formation of language and the basis of knowledge acquisition. The internal monologue of thought and communicated language use the same cognitive structures, the same semantic frameworks, the same lexical systems.

This is significant because we are made in God's image. Our ability to intelligibly create new things from nature is an extension of God's likeness, even though our creations are not transcendent. When we think, when we speak, when we plan and design and create, we are exercising a capacity that reflects—in a finite and constrained way—the creative capacity of our creator.

God speaks things into existence from nothing. We speak things into existence from something. God's Logos creates ex nihilo. Our logos reorganizes what already exists. But the same fundamental process—thought becoming reality through expression—is operative in both cases. The difference is one of magnitude and scope, not of kind.

This is why the Biblical narrative of the power that God gives us to be fruitful is clear and validated by our present reality and validated by the revelation and reorganization framework. Since no example stands to reason against this framework in that no reorganization has been demonstrated to transcend the limits of nature, then the perceived order of the universe is available at our disposal by direct permission and command from God.

## Thought and Creation

When an inventor uses the properties and behaviors of nature to reorganize those attributes to create new things, the invention starts with a thought. An awareness of the known properties of nature is a prerequisite to reorganizing in such a way to create a novel invention from it.

This framework of revelation and reorganization does not diminish the creative agency of humans. It frames it in a way that demonstrates the non-transcendent nature of human creation and intentionally juxtaposes it against the existence of nature, of which the origins are poorly understood by naturalist accounts.

We can see that human creation starts with thought. Perhaps it is recorded or communicated orally. Nonetheless, this thought is still linguistic and derived from lexical and semantic structures of language. This order, this intrinsic language of the universe in which we can intelligibly reorder it, transcends culture, language, grammar, and people groups.

Throughout history, great thinkers and innovators from around the world have contributed to the legacy of human invention. They have all done so through the same lexical means. There is nothing distinct about the means of creation in that it all starts with thoughts. This demonstrates that there is no difference between thought and speech in that the thought can then be manifested in speech or writing to record it for posterity.

Most importantly, this directly reflects the attributes of our creator, albeit within a limited capacity and most definitely constrained by the laws of nature.

## The Intelligibility of the Universe

The existence of the Logos explains something that naturalism cannot adequately account for: the intelligibility of the universe.

We can see that humans are capable of understanding, reasoning, and rationalizing the world around us through thought and language. Mathematics, art, language, and science demonstrate that humans have perceived a predictable order of the world around us.

Despite increasing <abbr title="A measure of disorder or randomness in a system; the tendency of systems to move toward disorder over time">entropy</abbr> as time goes on, the universe has obviously not become less intelligible. While no claims as to why that are offered in this writing, it is self-evident that humans have not lost any intelligible resolution of the state of the universe.

Why is the universe rationally ordered? Why does it operate according to principles that can be understood through reason? Why is mathematics—a product of human thought—so unreasonably effective at describing physical reality?

The naturalist must appeal to brute fact or fortunate coincidence. The universe just happens to be intelligible. We just happen to have evolved cognitive capacities suited to understanding it. These answers explain nothing. They merely restate the observation in different words.

The doctrine of the Logos provides a substantive answer. The universe is intelligible because it was created through the Logos—through divine reason and expression. The rational order we perceive in nature is not an illusion or a fortunate accident. It is the signature of its creator. The universe is intelligible because it was spoken into existence by a rational God.

And we can perceive this intelligibility because we are made in that same God's image. Our capacity for reason reflects—in finite form—the divine reason that undergirds reality. We are not imposing order on a chaotic universe. We are perceiving the order that was built into it by its creator.

## Christ's Authority Over Nature

The Logos is not merely a theological or philosophical concept. It is revealed in a person. And that person demonstrates authority over nature that confirms his identity as the divine Logos.

_'And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.'_

_Mark 4:37-39 ESV_

Let's examine the key terms. "Windstorm" is [G2978](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2978.html):

**Strong's #2978:** _lailaps_ (pronounced lah'-ee-laps)

_of uncertain derivation; a whirlwind (squall):--storm, tempest._

"Rebuked" is [G2008](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2008.html):

**Strong's #2008:** _epitimao_ (pronounced ep-ee-tee-mah'-o)

_from 1909 and 5091; to tax upon, i.e. censure or admonish; by implication, forbid:--(straitly) charge, rebuke._

"Said" is [G2036](https://www.studylight.org/lexicons/eng/greek/2036.html):

**Strong's #2036:** _epo_ (pronounced ep'-o)

_a primary verb (used only in the definite past tense, the others being borrowed from 2046, 4483, and 5346); to speak or say (by word or writing):--answer, bid, bring word, call, command, grant, say (on), speak, tell. Compare 3004._

A <abbr title="An examination of two or more items to establish similarities and differences; systematic comparison">comparative analysis</abbr> of God in Genesis who demonstrates command over nature, matter, and the universe shows that Christ, as revealed as the Logos in John 1:1, bears the same controls over the attributes and behaviors of nature with his voice. Christ revealed himself as transcendent in human form, clearly apparent to a multitude of senses.

Christ speaks to the wind and the sea, and they obey. This is not magic. This is not manipulation of natural forces through superior knowledge. This is the Logos—the one through whom all things were made—exercising authority over his own creation. The storm obeys because the one who spoke it into existence commands it to be still.

## The Divinity of Christ

Throughout the Gospels, many miracles of Christ are documented establishing Christ's transcendence over the laws of nature—the healing of lepers, the lame, the blind; the healing at the touch of a garment. He raised the dead, healed the sick, turned water into wine, and demonstrated his power to us in his full divinity. He did this in ways that defied our understanding of nature, and we perceived it with our senses.

This evidence, along with the fact that many eyewitness accounts are documented that Christ rose from the grave, demonstrate that Christ was not constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature—an obvious limitation of the human mind and body.

Many wonder how God could be human and God at the same time. It is quite a profound question. However, the revelation of Christ as the Logos in John 1:1 demonstrates that Jesus had authority over nature. Therefore, due to the limitations of the human mind in constructing transcendent realities, it is only natural that this phenomenon would defy our understanding. However, the reality of it being so is not predicated on our understanding of it. This is a fundamental property of revelation in this empirical framework. The reality of something being true that is revealed to us is not instantiated because of our awareness of it, and no evidence to the contrary exists.

The <abbr title="The quality of being unlikely to be true or to occur; the state of having low probability">improbability</abbr> of Christ's divinity based on human understanding is not a compelling case against it. Furthermore, our ability to understand or conceive of Christ's full divinity and full humanity are not necessary for it to be so. Humans' inability to create transcendent realities limits our ability to impose our empirical or epistemological understandings on them for no other reason than our awareness of the transcendent is not of our own making.

The evidence is unsubstantiated that humans can reorganize abstract concepts into transcendent realities, let alone concrete ones. Therefore, Christ's full divinity and full personhood, despite the improbability of it being so, or our inability to conceive of it, does not inherently make it false. The revelation and reorganization framework for knowledge acquisition demonstrates that our capacity to conceive of the divine through reorganization is impossible. Therefore, Christ's divinity can only be revealed.

## The Word Made Flesh

_'And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.'_

_John 1:14 ESV_

The Logos—the divine reason and expression through which all things were made—became flesh. The one who spoke the universe into existence from nothing entered that universe as a human being. This is the ultimate revelation. God did not merely speak to us from heaven. God did not merely appear in fire or storm. God became one of us.

This is not a concept that humans could construct through reorganization. We have no framework for conceiving of the transcendent becoming immanent, the infinite becoming finite, the creator entering his creation. This defies every category of human thought. And that is precisely the point. If we could conceive of it, we might have invented it. But we cannot conceive of it, which means we could not have invented it. The incarnation of the Logos is revelation, pure and simple.
