We have traveled a long road together.

We began by examining how humans acquire knowledge—through revelation and reorganization. We established that language forms the basis of thought, and that all vocabulary originates either from direct experience with nature or from the reorganization of concepts already revealed. We demonstrated empirically that no human creation has ever exceeded the constraints of the natural order. Not once. Not ever.

From this foundation, we asked a critical question: Can humans invent God? The answer, grounded in observation and reason, is no. If God is transcendent—existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe—then humans have no means to construct such a concept through reorganization. We cannot create transcendent realities from non-transcendent materials. It has never been done.

And yet we possess awareness of God. This awareness spans every culture, every era, every corner of human existence. If we did not create this awareness, where did it come from?

It came from God. He revealed himself to us.

We examined that revelation—through sensory means and spiritual means. We heard God's footsteps in the Garden. We heard his voice from the burning bush, from the whirlwind, from heaven itself. We saw his communication through dreams and visions and the still small voice. We understood that we can perceive God at all because we are made in his image—bearing a spiritual resemblance to our creator that gives us the capacity to know him.

We explored the Logos—the divine Word through whom all things were made, who was with God and who was God. We saw that God speaks things into existence from nothing, while we speak things into existence from something. Our creative capacity reflects his, but it does not match it. We are image-bearers, not gods.

We demonstrated that science and faith are not enemies but partners—that revelation empowers naturalism by providing the rational order that makes scientific investigation possible.

All of this has been building to something. All of this has been pointing somewhere.

It has been pointing to him.

## The Problem We Cannot Solve

The framework of revelation and reorganization demonstrates that humans are constrained. We cannot transcend nature. We cannot create matter ex nihilo. We cannot usurp the laws that govern the universe we inhabit.

But there is another constraint that this framework illuminates—a constraint far more devastating than our creative limitations.

We are morally constrained.

From the beginning, God gave humanity one command in the Garden. One boundary. One test of trust and obedience.

_'And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."'_

_Genesis 2:16-17 ESV_

Adam and Eve violated that command. They reached beyond the boundary God had set. And in doing so, they introduced something into the human condition that no amount of reorganization can fix.

Sin.

Sin is not merely bad behavior. It is not a collection of mistakes that can be corrected with effort or education. Sin is a fundamental rupture in the relationship between creator and creation. It is the creature declaring independence from the one who made him. It is rebellion against the only source of life and goodness and truth.

And the consequence of sin is death. Not merely physical death, though that is part of it. Spiritual death. Separation from God. The severing of the very relationship for which we were created.

This is the problem we cannot solve.

We cannot reorganize our way out of sin. We cannot invent a solution. We cannot construct a ladder from earth to heaven through our own ingenuity. Every human creation is constrained by nature, and nature provides no mechanism for bridging the infinite gap between a holy God and a sinful humanity.

If there is to be a solution, it must come from outside us. It must come from God.

It must be revealed.

## The Love of God

The very act of God revealing himself to us indicates to us the nature of God's character. A God that would reveal himself to his creation not once, but a multitude of times indicates intent. It is God's intent that humans should know him. It is God's intent that his word should be recorded through the gifts that God has given his creation. It is God's intent that humans should have a relationship with him.

We can know this intent because it is recorded in the snapshot of the Bible. We don't need to guess, extrapolate, hypothesize, or infer. The very nature of revelation dictates that the pre-existing God of the Bible came before his creation and made himself known to us.

But God did not merely reveal information about himself. He did not simply send messages or signs or prophets.

He came himself.

_'And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.'_

_John 1:14 ESV_

The Logos—the divine Word through whom all things were made—entered his own creation. The transcendent became immanent. The infinite took on finitude. God became man.

This is the ultimate revelation. This is the answer to the problem we cannot solve.

## The Life of Christ

Jesus of Nazareth lived a human life. He was born. He grew. He experienced hunger and thirst, fatigue and grief. He walked the dusty roads of Palestine. He ate with sinners and touched lepers. He wept at the tomb of a friend.

But he lived that human life without sin. In every moment, in every choice, in every temptation, he maintained perfect alignment with the Father's will. He demonstrated what human life was meant to be—what we were created for before the rupture of sin distorted everything.

Throughout the Gospels, many miracles of Christ are documented establishing Christ's transcendence over the laws of nature—the healing of lepers, the lame, the blind; the healing at the touch of a garment. He raised the dead, healed the sick, turned water into wine, and demonstrated his power to us in his full divinity. He did this in ways that defied our understanding of nature, and we perceived it with our senses.

He calmed storms with a word. He walked on water. He multiplied bread and fish to feed thousands. These were not tricks or illusions. These were demonstrations that the one performing them had authority over nature itself—because he was the one through whom nature was made.

The Logos who spoke creation into existence was now walking among his creation, showing them who he was.

## The Death of Christ

But Jesus did not come merely to demonstrate his power or to teach moral principles. He came to die.

This is the scandal at the heart of Christianity. The God who spoke the universe into existence allowed himself to be nailed to a Roman cross.

_'For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.'_

_John 3:16 ESV_

The cross was not an accident. It was not a tragic end to a promising ministry. It was the purpose for which Christ came. He came to die in our place.

We have established that the consequence of sin is death—separation from God. This is a debt we cannot pay. We cannot reorganize our way out of it. We cannot construct a bridge across the infinite chasm our rebellion has created.

But God can.

On the cross, Jesus took upon himself the full weight of human sin. The holy one became sin for us. The source of life experienced death. The eternal Son was forsaken by the Father so that we would never have to be.

_'He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.'_

_1 Peter 2:24 ESV_

This is not a concept we could construct through reorganization. The idea that God would become man, live a sinless life, and then die a criminal's death to pay a debt owed by those who rebelled against him—this exceeds every category of human thought. We would never invent this. We could never conceive of it.

It is pure revelation. It is God's plan, revealed in history, accomplished in the flesh of Jesus Christ.

## The Resurrection of Christ

If the story ended at the cross, it would be tragedy. But it does not end there.

On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead.

This is the historical claim upon which Christianity stands or falls. The apostles did not preach moral teachings or philosophical insights. They preached a resurrection. They claimed that the man who was crucified under Pontius Pilate was alive again—that they had seen him, touched him, eaten with him.

The evidence, along with the fact that many eyewitness accounts are documented that Christ rose from the grave, demonstrate that Christ was not constrained by the properties and behaviors of nature—an obvious limitation of the human mind and body.

Death could not hold him because he is the source of life. The grave could not contain him because he is the Logos through whom all things were made. Nature's most absolute boundary—the finality of death—yielded to its creator.

The resurrection is not a metaphor. It is not a spiritual truth dressed in physical language. It is an event that happened in history, attested by witnesses who went to their deaths proclaiming its reality.

And it changes everything.

## God Chose Us

Here is the heart of it all.

We did not choose God. We did not discover him through our ingenuity. We did not construct a path to him through our reorganization of natural concepts. We could not have done any of these things. We are constrained.

But God is not constrained.

He chose to create us. He chose to make us in his image. He chose to reveal himself to us—through prophets and priests, through burning bushes and still small voices, through dreams and visions and thundering declarations from heaven.

And when our sin created a chasm we could not cross, he chose to cross it himself.

He chose us.

_'But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.'_

_Romans 5:8 ESV_

We were not waiting for God. We were not seeking him. We were rebels, running in the opposite direction, constructing our own towers of Babel in the vain hope that we could reach heaven through our own efforts.

And while we were running, he came after us.

The Logos who spoke the universe into existence spoke our names. The God who walked in the Garden came walking after us. The one who owes us nothing gave us everything.

This is grace. This is love. This is the God of revelation.

## The Response

Throughout this series, I have presented a framework for understanding knowledge, creation, and the nature of God. I have used logic, reason, and empirical observation. I have consulted the original languages of Scripture and examined the Hebrew and Greek terms that undergird our theology.

But knowledge is not enough.

The demons know who God is. They do not love him. They do not trust him. They do not surrender to him.

The question is not merely whether you understand the framework or agree with the arguments. The question is what you will do with the God who has revealed himself to you.

Because he has revealed himself. If you have read this series, you have encountered the claims of Scripture. You have seen the evidence that God cannot be a human invention. You have considered the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.

You have been confronted with revelation.

And revelation demands a response.

## The Invitation

The Bible is clear about what that response looks like.

_'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.'_

_Romans 10:9 ESV_

This is not complicated. It does not require advanced degrees or philosophical sophistication. It requires confession and belief.

Confess that Jesus is Lord. Not merely a good teacher. Not merely a moral example. Lord. The one who has authority over your life. The one to whom you owe allegiance. The one who died in your place and rose again.

Believe that God raised him from the dead. Not a metaphorical resurrection. Not a spiritual experience. A bodily resurrection, attested by witnesses, vindicated by history. Believe that death could not hold him because he is who he claimed to be.

This is faith. This is the response that revelation demands.

## A Humble and Reasoned Faith

All of that being said, the responsibility of accepting or denying the Biblical truths that bolster this framework is entirely up to you. This writing makes no efforts to coerce you into accepting its positions, but it does present a compelling case for them.

Ultimately, the role of faith is to accept compelling evidence where no physical evidence can be called upon at will.

Given that God is a transcendent God that resides in a dimension that is inaccessible to us by definition, and that only God can choose to move between those dimensions, then our faith in God resides in the acceptance of that fact.

Despite the power of the revelation and reorganization framework, God himself is not empirically validatable. Only the fact that he cannot be created is empirically validated. Knowing that we can reason God's existence, however, provides a compelling case for belief in God.

This is not blind faith. This is reasoned faith. This is faith that stands on the foundation of logic, observation, and the testimony of Scripture. This is faith that acknowledges our limitations while embracing the God who has no limitations.

This is humility. And it is the beginning of wisdom.

## The God Who Speaks

Through the framework of revelation and reorganization we can see that God has revealed himself to us both sensorially and spiritually. In the Garden, God clearly dwelt with Adam and Eve. His footsteps were audible to them. His voice was audible to them. Throughout the Bible, many documented cases of sensory awareness of God are recorded.

This sensory awareness of God is important because the framework of revelation and reorganization states that God cannot be a human construct because we have no means to create transcendent entities from the properties and behaviors of nature. No human has ever created a single thing that has ever exceeded the known physical properties and constraints of the physical world.

Given that fact, there is no basis that humans could abstract God and have only ever accomplished that once. We could do that again, and again, and again if it were true. More interestingly, if it were true that humans could abstract God, then why couldn't we abstract another transcendent entity by another name for another transcendent purpose, or create matter and universes by mere thought?

The limitation of language to even conjure up a transcendent entity on the spot, or to create matter ex nihilo, demonstrates the weakness of reorganization as a means to abstract transcendent beings.

## The Final Word

Since we know that humans have no capacity to create God, then our awareness of God can only be explained through revelation. It is well documented in Biblical scripture where God interacts with us both physically and spiritually engaging both our spirits and our senses. Our awareness of God is well understood to be from the interaction with him, not just assuming his existence, or inventing him to comfort ourselves in the presence of adversity or death.

Given that this framework of revelation and reorganization epistemologically establishes that humans have no empirical basis for creating transcendent beings, we are left only with one possibility. Our awareness of God can only be attributed to his actual existence and him making himself known to us.

The Bible is unique in its position of justifying a dualistic nature of human existence. In the final analysis, it is no longer necessary that God be a God of the gaps. After all, the gaps that are now filled with empirical analysis have not dictated from where those natural properties and behaviors came from, only that we have observed them.

To find the answer to their origins, we must humble ourselves to faith in a creator that has made himself known to us time and time again.

He walked in the Garden. He spoke from the fire. He thundered from heaven. He whispered in the night. He entered his creation as a baby, lived as a man, died as a sacrifice, and rose as a conqueror.

He chose us.

The question now is whether you will choose him.

_'Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.'_

_Revelation 3:20 ESV_

He is knocking.

Will you open the door?
