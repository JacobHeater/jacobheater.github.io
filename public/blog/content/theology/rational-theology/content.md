Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, right?
I'm not daft enough to disagree with this statement, I'm
just not foolish enough to believe that theological claims
are extraordinary. Have you found yourself debating with
the seemingly irrational claims of theistic belief? Or,
maybe you levvy the allegations against the faithful that their metaphysical baseline is extraordinary. If you'll open
your mind with me for just a moment, if you are a doubter,
I'd like to show you that theistic belief is the basis
for your rationalism.

## We're Getting Dumber

It's interesting to me that the more advanced society gets
technologically, the more foolish we become. To be clear, this
is not merely an observation on my part. Evidence is emerging
to support these conclusions, indeed even more so in the
manifestation of our AI companions.

Am I cherrypicking? Maybe. The point I'm really making
is why are we so sure in our decrescendoing intelligence
that theological claims are so extraordinary? This is
not an appeal to tradition, or conservatism bias. Contrarily,
this is a call to deeply explore the **historical** claims
of theism, and juxtapose them against modern conclusions.

## Weak Naturalism

_All natural things have natural causes_. That's what strict
naturalists would claim. Problem number one is that it is an obviously circular claim. Problem number two is that what
frame is that claim being made from? Can nature stand outside
of itself to certify itself as the cause of itself? Certainly
not! Even the question gets your head spinning, which is a
**reasonable** indicator that something isn't making sense.

Here's an example about perspective. The universe is expanding, but from which vantage point do
we make that observation, from within it or from outside of
it? It's one perspective to stand outside of the bounds of the
universe and to declare that it is certainly expanding. It's
another thing declare that from within it. To be clear, I'm
not saying the universe is **NOT** expanding. I'm just
highighting our vantage point within it. The position of
the naturalist observer is within the bounds of the unvierse.
So, what frame are they declaring its causality from?

## Circular Reasoning

Frustratingly, both sides accuse each other some form of
logical fallacy. Theists accuse the detractors, particularly
those of naturalist leanings of circular reasoning.
Naturalists accuse the theists of infinite regresses. However,
we know that not both things can be true. How do we know this?
Because the laws of cause and effect tell us so. There are
underpinning facets of reality that make it easy for us to
trace causality. The common ground is that both attempt to
grapple with causality, but there can not be two co-existent
causes.

The claim that theism results in an infinite regress is only
true if God is bound to nature. If God is part of His
creation, then He caused Himself. The age old question of who
caused God is one of the oldest tactics used by doubters to
attempt to gain leverage on theists, but it's a self-defeating
question.

## God as Transcendent

For God to have caused nature, God must be apart from nature.
If it were not so, then God caused Himself, and we end up with
the same circular reasoning that naturalists would have us
believe. Nature caused nature caused nature is equivalent to
God caused God caused God. The trouble with self-causation is
that it never resolves.

Things that don't resolve are infinite. Things that are
infinite are constant. Neither of those two modes of being
appear to describe any facet of nature that I am aware of.
The fact that God is God is God is an infinite regress is
because that statement is defining God as He is described in
the Bible. God is described as infinite in the Bible.
Ontologically comparing the two things, the universe does not
appear to be infinite â€” see its expanding nature, for example
indicating that it is not constant, and therefore not
infinite. God, however, because of the nature of the
unresolving God created God created God issue, does
demonstrate His infiniteness. Inifniteness is outside of
nature. God is transcendent precisely because he is not
confined by nature.

The way that our minds grapple with God is not at odds with
the way God describes Himself to us in His revelation.
The same cannot be said to be true for how nature reveals
itself to us. Of these two ontological claims, one is
demonstrably not true. So, how do we wrestle with an
unprovable God? To me, the obvious answer is within our
minds.
