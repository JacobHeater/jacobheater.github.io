Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, right?
I'm not daft enough to disagree with this statement; I'm
just not foolish enough to believe that theological claims
are extraordinary. Have you found yourself debating with
the seemingly irrational claims of theistic belief? Or,
maybe you levy the allegations against the faithful that
their metaphysical baseline is extraordinary. If you'll open
your mind with me for just a moment, if you are a doubter,
I'd like to show you that theistic belief aligns better with
the understanding of natural causality than naturalism
itself.

## Exposing Recency Bias

Modern living affords us many comforts, and it is certainly
in these comforts that we derive a sort of superiority complex
compared to the lives of our ancestors. Yet, we forget that
much of the knowledge that we have today was established
significantly earlier than the watershed of the industrial
revolution. Indeed, the greatest thinkers of our time predate
the automobile, air conditioning, computers, and microwave ovens.
We have a tendency toward a recency bias that wants to attribute
much of our intelligence to modern human minds, but that is
simply not the case.

It's interesting to me that the more advanced society gets
technologically, the more foolish we become. To be clear, this
is not merely an observation on my part. Evidence is emerging
to support these conclusions, indeed even more so in the
manifestation of our AI companions.

Am I cherry-picking? Maybe. The point I'm really making
is why are we so sure in our decrescendoing intelligence
that theological claims are so extraordinary? This is
not an appeal to tradition or conservatism bias. Contrarily,
this is a call to deeply explore the **historical** claims
of theism and juxtapose them against modern conclusions.

Let's explore these historical claims against the modern
empiricist, naturalist argument that naturalism is the
most parsimonious explanation for reality. If the empiricists
are right, then modern understanding should lead to the
most rational conclusions. However, given that modern
understanding is leading to declining intelligence, this
seems to contradict its own claims.

## Weak Naturalism

_All natural things have natural causes._ That's what strict
naturalists would claim. Problem number one is that it is an
obviously circular claim. Problem number two is from what
frame is that claim being made? Can nature stand outside
itself to certify itself as the cause of itself? Certainly
not! Even the question gets your head spinning, which is a
**reasonable** indicator that something isn't making sense.

Here's an example about perspective. The universe is expanding,
but from which vantage point do
we make that observation, from within it or from outside of
it? It's one perspective to stand outside the bounds of the
universe and to declare that it is certainly expanding. It's
another thing to declare that from within it. To be clear, I'm
not saying the universe is **NOT** expanding. I'm just
highlighting our vantage point within it. The position of
the naturalist observer is within the bounds of the universe.
If you think of yourself blowing up a balloon, and prior to
doing so, you place an object inside the balloon. Both
perspectives can certify that while you're inflating the balloon
that balloon is expanding, but the perspectives and observations
that conclude it to be so will be different.

From the object inside the balloon, the space inside the
balloon is increasing. From outside the balloon, the actor
acting on the balloon sees it expanding not be evaluating
the interior space, but by observing the expanding bounds
of the balloon. Two different perspectives can lead to the
same conclusion, but the modes of evaluation are different.

What does this have to do with causality? The example is apt.
The actor knows themselves to be the cause. The inhabitant of
the balloon can extrapolate the cause. Is it the forced air that
is entering the space from the actor on the balloon? Is it
natural forces that cause the balloon to expand? Of course,
the frame being from within the balloon and having no other
perspective from which to analyze, the conclusions may seem
most appropriate to analyze it from within the context of the
balloon. The actor on the balloon knows the precise cause.
As we can see, the frame of analysis matter. From what frame are
naturalists declaring full knowledge of causality?

## Circular Reasoning

Frustratingly, both sides accuse each other of some form of
logical fallacy. Theists accuse the detractors, particularly
those of naturalist leanings, of circular reasoning.
Naturalists accuse the theists of infinite regresses. However,
we know that not both things can be true. How do we know this?
Because the laws of cause and effect tell us so. There are
underpinning facets of reality that make it easy for us to
trace causality. The common ground is that both attempt to
grapple with causality, but there cannot be two co-existent
causes.

The claim that theism results in an infinite regress is only
true if God is bound to nature. If God is part of His
creation, then He caused Himself. The age-old question of who
caused God is one of the oldest tactics used by doubters to
attempt to gain leverage on theists, but it's a self-defeating
question.

## God as Transcendent

For God to have caused nature, God must be apart from nature.
If it were not so, then God caused Himself, and we end up with
the same circular reasoning that naturalists would have us
believe. Nature caused nature caused nature is equivalent to
God caused God caused God. The trouble with self-causation is
that it never resolves.

Things that don't resolve are infinite. Things that are
infinite are constant. Neither of those two modes of being
appear to describe any facet of nature that I am aware of.
The fact that God is God is God is an infinite regress is
because that statement is defining God as He is described in
the Bible. God is described as infinite in the Bible.
Ontologically comparing the two things, the universe does not
appear to be infinite â€” see its expanding nature, for example,
indicating that it is not constant, and therefore not
infinite. God, however, because of the nature of the
unresolving God created God created God issue, does
demonstrate His infiniteness. Infiniteness is outside of
nature. God is transcendent precisely because He is not
confined by nature.

The way that our minds grapple with God is not at odds with
the way God describes Himself to us in His revelation.
The same cannot be said to be true for how nature reveals
itself to us. Of these two ontological claims, one is
demonstrably not true. So, how do we wrestle with a
transcendent God, a God who is not available to our empirical
prodding and testing? We'll explore that in our next series
where we'll talk about the empirical evidence pointing
to God.
