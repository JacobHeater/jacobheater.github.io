One of the oldest tactics of detractors of faith in God
is that they'll accuse the believer of having invented God.
Along that same line of attack, they'll claim God is a
social construct, a tool used by governments to control the
population. They'll use naturalist claims to attempt to
relegate God to a byproduct of evolution claiming that
evolution is, in fact, what has allowed the human brain
to have spiritual, divine, or otherwise transcendent
experiences. Is there any truth to this claim? I can
assure you, you do not need to rely on appeals to tradition,
authority, or dogmatism to refute this claim. We can do
so by engaging with the argument and dismantling it with
empiricism, knowledge, and rational discourse.

## Dismantle the Claims

To engage with the argument, we must first understand precisely
what detractors are accusing believers of. The core of the
argument can be distilled down to that God is a product of
the mind. In all the arguments, the claim is that God has been
conceived of by the natural processes in your own brain, the
brains of other believers, or the brains of malicious government
actors to control your mind. In any case, the crux of the
argument is that God isn't real and God can be constructed purely
by natural processes — in this case neurological and cognitive
processes.

That seems like a particularly hard argument to debunk if you
look at it at face value. They're accusing me (and you) of inventing
something that I cannot, on a whim, bring to them and say, "Don't
you see? Here's God right here!" Indeed, I suppose if I could do that
then, God wouldn't be God. I won't rely on that alone to dismantle the
claim though, since that is an appeal to authority of God. Instead,
the claim is even easier to dismantle if you engage with it on their
terms. Let's begin.

## Products of the Mind

Throughout human history, humans have a track record of inventing
some pretty amazing things. Our inventions build upon themselves
iteratively. We leverage nature and the forces that we observe to
build things that make faster, more efficient, and stronger. I
invite you to take a long pause for yourself, and think of some of
your favorite inventions throughout history.

![Human inventions](/blog/content/theology/can-humans-invent-god/inventions.png)

I've put a picture above illustrating probably some of the most
iconic inventions in human history, but let's be honest, these don't
capture the breadth of all inventions, but they will help illustrate
point. Did you take a moment to think through some of your favorite
inventions? If you didn't, that's fine, you can use the ones that I
captured in the exercise we're going to embark on.

What do all of these inventions, including the ones you may have thought
of have in common? They all use aspects of nature to make themselves
useful.

1. The lightbulb operates using electricity. When an electric current passes through a filament—typically made of tungsten—it encounters resistance, which causes the filament to heat up. This heat generates light in a process known as incandescence.

1. A car engine uses the combustion of gasoline (or another fuel) to ignite a mixture of air and fuel inside its cylinders. The resulting explosions drive the pistons, which turn the crankshaft and ultimately power the wheels.

   1. The round shape of tires helps minimize rolling resistance and ensures consistent contact with the road surface, contributing to smoother and more efficient driving.

1. A computer uses electricity and intricate circuitry to send electrical signals across components mounted on the motherboard. These signals control the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, and peripherals, enabling the computer to perform computations and run programs.

1. An airplane achieves flight through principles of aerodynamics and propulsion. Jet engines or propellers generate thrust by burning fuel (similar to a car engine), while the aerodynamic shape of the wings produces lift. The aircraft’s structure—often made from lightweight materials like aluminum—helps reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency.

---

The common thread here is that humans observe information about
nature, and leverage those facets of nature to make our lives
hopefully better. None of these inventions, however, break free
from the boundaries of nature. I don't see cars creating universes,
or lightbulbs generating new realities, or computers creating
matter without source, or airplanes setting the entirety of the
cosmos in motion. Contrarily, these inventions appear to be
finitely confined to their natural origins. Even more apparent,
these inventions don't work together to exceed the forces of
nature.

## Describing God

The God of the Bible is described as the source of all creation.
He is described as omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. If
God is the source of nature, then He is not created with nature.
This doesn't exclude Him from dwelling in nature, nor does it
exclude Him from dwelling beyond it, despite how difficult it
might be for us to conceive what could possibly lie beyond nature,
if we can conceive of it at all. Let's recap.

1. God is the source of all nature and reality.
1. He is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent.
1. God can move in and out of His creation in ways that are
   difficult for humans to conceive of.

So, let's lay out the argument. Detractors of theology are
accusing believers of inventing a being that is the
source of nature, that has properties and attributes unlike
anything in nature, and can be in dimensions of nature unlike
anything in nature. Then, what we have here is a special product
of the human mind. But, what we do know is that humans can and
do routinely interact with nature to our advantage to come up
with novel inventions to better ourselves. If the argument is
that I can invent sources of reality simply by imagining it,
why haven't I done this beyond the concept of God? Where are
the other inventions that defy nature?

## Special Pleading

Let's define special pleading.

> Special pleading is an informal fallacy wherein a person claims an exception to a general or universal principle, but the exception is unjustified. It applies a double standard.
> [Special Pleading — Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading)

The reason that the accusation that humans invent God,
divine, spiritual, or otherwise transcendent concepts is special
pleading is that it doesn't meet the cognitive threshold for
the criteria of other human inventions abstract or otherwise.
Even in less tangible examples, we can see the same patterns of
human inventions being bound by nature, despite their seeming
appearance of novelty or departure from reality.

1. The unicorn is an amalgamation of a horse and horned animals.
1. Imaginary universes in fiction works are inspired by and do not
   depart from nature that we live in.
1. Purely abstract mathematics are derived from more fundamental
   quantification in nature, and cannot exist without their
   predicates.

No human invention has ever, nor will they ever escape their
natural confines to go on to create new realities or generate
matter without source. So, why should we accept at face value
that we can purely abstract an entity that can do such a thing?

The special pleading fallacy applies because accusers are asking
us to accept at face value that humans have ever only one time
created an idea in pure abstraction that is the source of all
reality and nature in which we dwell when no other human invention
has ever met that bar. That, by definition, is **special pleading**.

## Conclusion

We explored the accusation that God is a social construct,
a product of the human mind, or a product of human neurological
and cognitive processes. We dismantled the argument by inspecting
well-known human inventions, and you, the reader was invited to
do a deep dive into the history of human invention to find examples
where humans have invented something that exceeds the confines of
nature. By that analysis, we concluded that no human invention meets that bar, and therefore the claim that humans invented God
through a product of our natural neurological and cognitive
processes is not a valid claim and is special pleading. Therefore,
we must reject this claim.

## Invitation

Please join me in the next entry in the theology series as
we explore the empirical basis for how humans could, and
do know about God. We will explore the mechanisms for how
humans acquire knowledge, apply the theory to some of the
examples used in this entry, and demonstrate that through
the theory of how humans acquire knowledge, that God revealed
Himself to us through direct revelation.

Thanks for reading!
